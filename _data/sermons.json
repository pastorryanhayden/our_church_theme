Acts 16.  We are going to read verses 6-24.\n\nThis is a passage that tells us about the conversion of two people.  Two ladies. They couldn't be more different.  But the key player in this story isn't Paul - and it isn't these two ladies - it's the Holy Spirit.  It's God working.\n\nBut I do want to say something about the fact that this story talks about two ladies.  There are lots of people out there who want to paint Christians as mysogynists and sexists.  We are the ones who are holding woman down. We are a bunch of knuckle dragging neanderthals and it's the savvy people - the people who live in places like New York and California that care about women.\n\nThat's a very shallow view of history and a view that displays total ignorance of the Bible.  At the time of Christ - most of the countries of the world treated woman like dirt.  You could do to your wife whatever you wanted with no consequence.  If she messed up your breakfast  - you could kill her and it wouldn't matter.  Killing girl babies was extremely common.  Forced prostitution was extremely common.    Having more than one wife was extremely common.  Keeping concubines was extremely common.  It was totally normal for a Roman to be married more than 3 or 4 times.  Woman had no protection and no status.\n\nBut you would barely see that if you read the New Testament.  Many of the heroes of the New Testament were woman: Mary, Elizabeth, Mary Magdalene, Dorcas, Lois and Eunice, Eudioas and Syntyche and on and on.  We don't totally get their role - but their were female prophets mentioned many times in the New Testament.  The church is \"the bride of Christ\" that God loved, cherished and sacrificed for.\n\nThe early Christian church wasn't anti-woman - not at all.\n\nHere in this chapter we see two woman who couldn't be more different but they had one thing in common - God was working in their lives, drawing them to himself.\n\nNow, I want to go through this story and explain it fairly quickly because I want to get to what the story teaches us.  **It starts by telling us about Paul and Silas' journey**.  They kept running into closed doors in Turkey and God made it clear to them in a vision that he wanted them to expand their ministry to Macedonia so they traveled from Western Turkey by boat north and west until they got to a city called Phillipi.\n\nLet me give you a quick geography lesson.  Macedonia is North and East of Greece.  It sort of makes a land bridge between Greece and Turkey.  Functionally though - it's a pretty Greek place.  Many people mistakenly think that the Greek's took over the world before the Romans did - that's wrong.  Phillip the great was a Macedonian.  He just loved greek culture and spread greek culture around the world.\n\n![Map](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47159282/pauls_second_journey1349342846464.jpg)\n\nSo they are leaving the Middle east and middle eastern culture moving into Europe and european culture.  And this first city that they go to is actually a Roman City.  It was considered a little part of Rome outside of Rome.  It was a local capitol - but never a huge city.  Think Springfield - not Chicago.  \n\nIn fact - they weren't even big enough to have a synagogue.  So, when Paul and Silas get there - they can't follow their normal pattern and preach in the synagogue - because there isn't one.  So they wait until the sabbath and they go to the river because it was customary for jews to gather by the river for prayer when their wasn't a synagogue.  \n\nAnd when they get their they meet an interesting woman - Lydia.  One of the things I learned studying this is that Lydia was probably her nickname - because it's actually the name of the place she was from.  The other name for Thyratyra was Lydia.  Thyratyra was known for purple dye.  She was from their and sold purple dye.  So it was probably a knickname or business name.\n\nAnyways, Lydia is not Jewish.  She’s a Gentile.  But she earnestly wants to worship God.  So even though she’s not Jewish  she is worshipping with the jews at the river and when she hears what Paul is saying about Jesus the Bible says *“Whose heart the Lord opened.”*  She accepts and believes the gospel and gets baptized.  Then brings that message to her house and they believe and are baptized.\n\nShe then begs Paul and his helpers to come and stay with her while they are in Philippi.\n\nSo, that’s the first woman.  A wealthy moral kind woman who was never anything but kind to Paul and his team.\n\nBut the next woman couldn’t be more different.  The story says that as they went praying they met this damsel - probably a teenage girl, who is a slave and who is demon possessed.  Her owners use her to make money by telling people she can tell the future.  So she’s some kind of psychic.\n\nWhen she sees Paul and Silas she starts following them around and yelling to whoever would hear *“These are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.”*  She follows them around doing this many days.  \n\nIf you are anything like me you might read that and think “Ok - why is that a problem?”  I mean - they ARE the servants of the most high God.  They are telling people the way of salvation.  So what is the problem?\n  \nThis girl is demon possessed.  She’s acting on the influence of demons.  I’m sure she was doing this in such a way that it really scared people and turned people off from the gospel.  So, finally Paul can’t take it any more.  The Bible says he is “grieved” but that word could mean “annoyed, miffed.”  He can’t take it - so he turns to her and says:\n\n> *”I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.”*\n\nHe was talking to the Demon.  He exorcised her.  And the Bible says \"He came out the same hour.\"  So, she was actually demon possessed and she was actually healed from it.  And she was immediately a different person.  The Bible doesn't say she got saved - but I think we can assume that she did.  \n\nWe know she was very different.  We know that because verse 18 says that her masters saw she was different.  They saw that their cash cow wasn't giving milk anymore and they got so mad about it that they incited a riot and got Paul and Silas thrown in jail.\n\nSo we have these two women, one a rich business woman who was very moral and religious and one who was a poor wretch who was a demon possessed.  But they both needed the same thing - they both needed Jesus.  They both needed salvation.\n\nNow what does God want us to learn from this story?  What are the lessons for us?  I have four of them for you this morning:\n\n# 1. God is seeking after people. \n\nJesus said in Luke 19:10\n\n> *\"For the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\"*\n\nGod wants to save people.  He is actively seeking sinners.  He is actively looking to save people and bring them to himself.  And I think we see this crystal clear in this story.\n\nIf you were to look at the way that Paul and his team travelled -  it doesn't make sense.  Every where they went God was closing doors sending them on a very narrow line to this little city of Philippi.  Why?\n\nI think it's because there was some people in Philippi that God wanted to hear the gospel, and God was moving the pieces in place.\n\nHave you ever thought about this?  God wants to save people.  He wants people to trust Him.  \n\nYou might hate your job.  You never planned on doing it.  You never wanted to do it.  It's not what you signed up for. And you might ask God \"Why?\" Every day.  Do you know, maybe there is a Lydia at your job that God wants you to share the gospel with.\n\nOr maybe you live in a crumby neighborhood and you want to get out.  You didn't plan on going there.  Have you ever thought that maybe their is a damsel in your neighborhood that needs you to share the life changing message of the gospel?\n\nI don't know. But I do know this - God is actively working to save people.  \n\nA second thing we can learn from this is:\n\n# 2. God is seeking after all kinds of people.\n\nIf I say, God wants to save people.  That's not a very controversial statement.  Most Christians would give some agreement to that.  But when we read the Bible it's clear that God wants to save all kinds of people.\n\nMost of us rejoice when we see another Lydia come into the church.  People with property and standing.  People with morals and religion.  People with nice clothes and nice language.  People who, like Lydia, have something to offer right away.  \n\nBut when God brings us into the path of a damsel girl.  Someone with a past. Someone with the marks of sin all over them.  Someone who is openly hostile to God.  We don't even think that God would save a person like that.  But God does and God can.\n\nAnd listen, the ground is level at the foot of the cross.  God wants to save the Lydia's of this world.  Praise the Lord for the Lydia's.  But God wants to save the slave girls too.  \n\nRemember what they accused Jesus of?  They didn't say \"Jesus, we can't stand you because you just are too high and holy.\"  No, they said \"You are a friend of publicans and sinners.  You are hanging out with THOSE people.\"\n\nThink of this.  I think this is beautiful.  I can't imagine a situation where Lydia and the damsel would have anything to do with each other - but with Christ they were sisters. In Christ they were part of the same spiritual family.\n\nGod wants to save people.  All people.  The creepy people at Bagelfest.  The uppity people at the restaurant.  The religious people in the pew.  God is after all of them.\n\nA third lesson from this story is similar.\n\n# 3. God is powerful enough to save those most enslaved by Satan.\n\nThis damsel girl was demon possessed.  She was literally being led and controlled by the devil.  It's likely she was used as a prostitute too.  And she follows Paul and Silas around for many days mocking them.  I think if there was anybody you could write off and say \"nope, she's too far gone\" it's this girl.  But God saved this girl.\n\nPaul said in Romans 1:16\n\n> *\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believe that; to the Jew first and also to the Greek.\"*\n\nThe gospel is *\"the power of God unto salvation.\"*. That word *power* is the Greek word *dunamis.*  It's the word we get \"dynamite\" from.  \n\nHebrews 4:12 says \n\n> *\"For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"*\n\nBoom.  Do you know what that means?  It means the gospel changes people.  It has the power, when it is clearly presented, to turn lost men into saved men.  To turn slaves into free people.  To turn children of the devil into children of God.\n  \nBoom.  Dunamis.  The power of God.\n\nAnd let me be clear before I move onto the last point - it is THE GOSPEL that saves.  These people weren't saved because of Paul's awesome delivery.  They weren't saved because Paul added another verse to the invitation or squeezed their hand a certain way.  They were saved because of the clarity of the gospel  and by the power of God.\n\nGod wants to save people - all kinds of people - even people who are the most ensnared by Satan.\n\nOne more point and we'll be done... \n\n# 4. When God is working, Satan will be pushing back (But God is working through that too).\n\nAt the end of our text this morning Paul and Silas face a riot, are falsely accused, and then beaten and thrown in jail. \n\nSatan pushed back and pushed back hard.  But a few verses later - we see that God was working to save the Philippians jailer and his household and that couldn't happen without Paul and Silas in jail.  \n\nSometimes, when we are faced with difficulty we think \"God can't be in this - it's hard\". But just because we are facing difficulty doesn't mean we are losing the fight.  It doesn't mean we are out of control.  It's all a part of God plan.\n\nSo, what is the point of this passage?  I think if I had to sum it up in a sentence it would be this:\n\nTrust God, follow His leading and share His word. Because He is after the Lydia's and the damsel girls of this world and He will save people when we are faithful and obedient.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"atta0qjwkAnN1b6ni","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/jAITo0QISkGGULzcICrY_2016%200724%20sunam.mp3","filename":"2016 0724 sunam.mp3","size":28591750,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","slides":[{"id":"attEX4FzDcD5WfPZe","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/fJU4yUolTDaAZGKfeSMm_Acts%2016-2%20slides.pdf","filename":"Acts 16-2 slides.pdf","size":22369720,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attEX4FzDcD5WfPZe-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attEX4FzDcD5WfPZe-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attSpu6Fdu24vgswY","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/NLcPLFiXQDONMhZ0yCEt_handout.pdf","filename":"handout.pdf","size":31197,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attSpu6Fdu24vgswY-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attSpu6Fdu24vgswY-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-07-24","bible_text":"Acts 16:6-24","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

Just a few verses really.  Let's read verses 1-13.\n\n> *\"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.\"*\n\nThere are two main things that happen in these verses:\n\n* Paul is paired up with one of his main helpers and his protege - Timothy\n* They move their mission into Europe.\n\nHonestly, there isn't a huge amount to go on in these verses.  Many of the commentaries I read didn't have much of anything to say about them.  One guy who I read who usually writes like a book on every chapter in Acts just folds this into another message.  \n\nDespite that - I think there are three lessons we can learn about doing God's work in this passage - they have to do with the personnel of God's work, the priorities of God's work, and the plan of God's work.  \n\nLet's pray and we'll jump in.\n\nThe first lesson I think we can learn here is about\n\n# 1. The **Personnel** of God's Work.\n\nThe very first thing that we see Paul doing here is taking on a new member in their team.  \n\nYou could almost get the impression from the end of chapter 15 - the John Mark episode - that Paul wasn't interested in working with other people.  But that's not true at all.  I think we see that Paul was always bringing people along and getting people to help him in the work God had called him to do.\n\nHere, Paul sees this young Timothy, who at this point may have been as young as 16, and Paul sees this the potential in Timothy and signs him up to be his helper.\n\n---\n\nLet's take a quick look at Timothy.  Hold your finger here and let's look at several scriptures about him:\n\nLet's look first at 2 Timothy 1:5\n\n> *\"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands\"*\n\nOne of the things that stands out about Timothy is that he was a person who had pure faith. \"Unfeigned faith\" as Paul puts it.  Another thing about him is that he knew the scriptures.  \n\nLet's look at another passage. Turn to 1 Cor. 14:17:\n\n> *\"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.\"*\n\nSo he was also someone who Paul considered a son, and he was faithful in the Lord.  \n\nBack in our text we get a few more details about Timothy:\n\n> *\"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.\"*\n\nSo...  \n\n* Even though He's a young person - he has a sterling reputation among the Christians in the area. \n* His father is a Greek - So Timothy is half jewish.\n\nLater on in Timothy's life he would be Paul's most trusted lieutenant and ultimately he ended up serving as the pastor of the church in Ephesus.\n\nWe also learn from the book of Timothy that Timothy was a little bit fearful, was probably self-conscious about how young he was, and had some minor health problems.\n\nSo that's Timothy. \n\n---\n\nNow, what does this teach us about the Personnel of God's work?\n\nTwo things I think we can learn:\n\nThe first is...\n\n## A. It takes a team.\n\nPaul realized that God's work was way to big for him to do by himself, he was going to have to have some help.  He was going to have to build a team.\n\nThat team included himself, Silas, Timothy, Titus, Luke and a bunch of other people: Aquilla and Priscella, Demas, Artemas, Tychicus, Appolos, Zenas and more.\n\nJohn C. Maxwell - the pastor/leadership guru is famous for saying:\n\n> \"Teamwork makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team.\n\nPaul gets all of the credit.  He's the name attached to it.  But Paul was just the leader - he had a great team of people behind him helping him.  They were all striving together towards the work God had called them to do.\n\nSometimes we think about famous people and their accomplishments all wrong.  Steve Jobs didn't create the iPhone - Steve Jobs led a team of hundreds of people who gave us the iPhone.  LeBron James didn't win the championship this year - LeBron James and a team did.  Thomas Jefferson didn't give us the declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman and Richard Henry Lee co-wrote it, and then the continental congress heavily edited it.\n\nLook, if our church is going to go anywhere - if we are going to accomplish any of our dreams, it's going to take teamwork.  If we are limited to what I can do or what someone else can do - we won't do much.\n\nAnd another thing - it really takes a team that cares more about sharing the work than sharing the glory.  Harry Truman is quoted as saying:\n\n> It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.\n\nGod's work should be done for God's glory.  He deserves the praise and the credit.  Whenever you get to thinking - \"I do more around here than so and so.\" You are on shaky ground.\n\nThis brings up the second lesson about the personnel of God's work.  Where does the team come from?  Where did Paul get Timothies and Tituses and Lukes?\n\nThe second lesson is:\n\n## B. It takes training.\n\nHold your finger here again and turn to 2 Timothy 2:2\n\n> *\"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\"*\n\nTimothy didn't start his journey with Paul a leader who was ready to take over the church at Ephesus - he had to learn a lot first, and he learned it on the job at the side of Paul.\n\nEphesians 4:11-12 says:\n\n> *\"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:\"*\n\nA lot of people think that it is the job of the pastors and the \"Full time Christian workers\" to do the work of the ministry - but that's not the case.  Our job is to perfect the saints so that you can do the work of the ministry.  Our job is primarily training.\n\nWhen you go to the Doctor, you probably appreciate the fact that they spend so much time in training.  Years and years of med-school plus residencies plus lots of ongoing training.  You understand that that is so important.\n\nWhen you think of great preachers from the 1800s there are two names that always come to people's minds: Charles Spurgeon in London and D.L. Moody in America.  Do you know that probably the biggest legacy that either of those men left was not the books they wrote or the sermons they preached - it was the people they trained to do the work of the ministry.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense.  But think about this - the greatest preacher who ever lived was Jesus and the PRIMARY thing that Jesus did on this earth wasn't miracles or even preaching, it was training.\n\nListen folks, time spent sharpening the axe isn't wasted time.  A call to do anything for God is a call to prepare and a call to be constantly learning.\n\nSo that's what this passage teaches us about the personnel of the Lord's work, the second thing I want you to see is:\n\n# 2. The priority of the Lord's work. \n\nLook again at verse 3:\n\n> *\"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek\"*\n\nThere are two amazing things that this verse teaches us that are really easy to miss:\n\nFirst, did you catch the phrase at the beginning *\"Him would Paul have to go forth with him\"*?  Remember how old Timothy is?  At the oldest, he's 25 years old here.  More likely he's still a teenager.  A teenager.\n\nWhat makes it even more interesting is that this passage seems to teach that Timothy's dad was either dead or out of the picture.  So here you have Timothy and he's just a teenager and he's about to leave his mother and grandmother and go out where?  We don't know.  Paul doesn't even know.\n\nRemember - no email.  No facetime.  No cell phones.  Not even phone books. \n\nThis teaches us an important lesson:\n\n## God's call should take priority over family ties.\n\nNow, let me be clear what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that being a Christian who feels like God is calling you to his work means you can ignore or mistreat your family.  I'm not saying that it's ok for a dad who is a pastor to be a bad dad for the Lord's sake.  \n\nWhat I am saying is that sometimes God calls us to leave our families.\n\nI can talk a little bit about this: I don't talk about this often, but the hardest part of being a pastor for me is being very far away from my family.  I have a very close family - not just my brothers and nieces and nephews.  But aunts and uncles and cousins and living grandparents.  It's tough.  When we go for a trip home and it's time to leave I want to blaze out of there not because I'm ready to go but because it's really tough to leave.\n\nBut, I believe I followed God here and that takes priority.\n\nYou've all heard of Hudson Taylor.  Do you know that Hudson Taylor went on a trip through the US to get missionaries and he told people at every stop and every church: I don't want your money - I want your sons and daughters.  I want you to meet me at such and such a place in California at such and such a time and when you meet me there - pack everything you have in a coffin, because you are likely never coming home.\n\nThat's tough.  But sometimes that's what it costs to follow God and do His work.\n\nThe second thing we see in this about the priority of the Lord's work is:\n\n## God's call should take priority over pride.\n\nBack in verse 3 notice that it says: \n\n> *and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters*\n\nWait a second?!  Hold the phone!  What?\n\nRemember last Sunday? (Don't worry - I barely do.)  Paul just got finished at the Jerusalem counsil where he was passionately arguing against asking new Christians to get circumcised.  Yet here, the first thing Paul has Timothy do is get circumcised.\n\nI'm not going into the details but this isn't a small ask.  This is a big deal.\n\nSo why did Paul do it?  It wasn't about salvation - Timothy was obviously saved already?  It was about ministry.  \n\nLet me ask you something - would there be anything wrong with Timothy not getting circumcised?  No.  Not a thing.  Paul established that in chapter 15 and in many places in his writings.  So why have Timothy circumcised?\n\nThe answer is simple - because it would help Timothy in his ministry.  He did it for others.\n\nTurn with me to 1 Corinthians 9 and let's look at verses 19-23:\n\n> *\"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.\"*\n\nI hear folks sometimes and they say things like \"Where in the Bible does it say that I have to ...\" and \"There is nothing wrong with...\"  and do you know what? A lot of the times, they are right.  They are right.  Absolutely.\n\nBut do you know, even if they are right, we aren't called to live on the plane of right and wrong  - that's the law.  We are called to live on the plane of grace.  We live by the law of grace and that is a much higher standard.\n\nSometimes grace says \"I know there is absolutely nothing wrong with this - but I'm going to abstain from it anyways because I want to be able to win these people.\"\n\nHere's the main point though - it's not about us being right, it's not about pride.  Timothy didn't come under the knife out of pride - he did it out of love.  Take a look at your standards that other people might question - do you do it out of pride?  Is it something you do so you can pat yourself on the back and say \"I'm glad I'm not like so and so.\"  You very well may be doing the right thing - but you are doing it for the wrong reason.\n\nLet me quickly move on to...\n\n# 3. The **plan** of God's Work:\n\nBack in our text, the Apostle Paul get's Timothy and begins to go around Asia Minor - modern day Turkey - visiting churches.  That's the plan.  But that's not what happens.\n\nGod keeps shutting doors.  God won't let them have peace about it.  Look at verses 6-7:\n\n> *\"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.\"*\n\nThen verse 9 says:\n\n> *\"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.\"*\n\nHere is the lesson:\n\n## God's work requires the leadership of God's Spirit","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attJpj031iktD0VLb","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/pm1QK2QCKzDBqBaHXwBM_2016%200717%20sun%20pm.mp3","filename":"2016 0717 sun pm.mp3","size":21159936,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday PM","date":"2016-07-17","bible_text":"Acts 16:1-13","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

I read a lot of them.  I'm reading one right now about a missionary to the middle east.  Do you know what I hate though?  I hate reading a biography that makes a person out to be faultless.  I've read many biographies where the author's intent wasn't to tell the story of someone's life - it was to make that person some kind of larger-than-life saint.  The fancy word for that is \"hagiography.\"  I hate hagiography.\n\nDo you know why? \n\nBecause no one is really like that.  No.  One.\n \nIf you actually knew Abraham Lincoln or George Washington or Amelia Earhart  or Charles Spurgeon or whoever - you might think they were kind of a jerk. Of maybe they smelled funny.  Or maybe they couldn't match their clothes.  Or maybe they had weird habits.  Because no one is perfect.\n\nOne of the things I love about the Bible is that it doesn't give us hagiography.  When it tells us about men, it portrays them as men.  Not as giants.  Not as statues of perfection.  Men.  It tells us about David's adultery, his parental failures, and his failed marriages.  It tells us about Moses' temper and his rough relationship with his wife.  It tells us about Esther's reluctance to rush into the throne room for her people.  It tells us about Peter's denial of Christ and when Paul had to confront him because he was being hypocritical.  It gives us people lumps and all.\n\nOur story this morning is a great reminder of that.  Truthfully, if I were writing this - I don't know that I would give this detail - but I didn't write it, God did, and He did it for our learning.\n\nLet's read Acts 15:36-41 with me:\n\n> *\"[Act 15:36-41 KJV] 36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how they do. 37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.\"*\n\nThis story is pretty simple, it doesn't take a lot of explanation.  So far, Paul and Barnabas - or really Barnabas and Paul - have been going around starting churches and evangelizing the lost.  They are the dynamic duo. The first missionaries.\n\nPaul is the super-educated persecutor turned super-missionary.\nBarnabas, the Levite, is the encouraging, godly guy willing to do anything for the cause of Christ.\n\nThey seem like they are inseperable.  Like they are going to last forever.  Then Acts 15 happens and we are like \"I didn't see that coming.\"\n\nIt's like batman and robin or the lone ranger and tonto have a breakup.  No one expects it.  It's like Kevin Durant going to Golden State.  No one sees it coming and it isn't going to be a pretty split.\n\nHere is what happened:  \n\nThe decided it was time to go back and visit the churches they had started. \n\nGreat.  All good.  No problem.  Let's do it.\n\nSo Barnabas says, let me go get my cousin John Mark and we'll bring him along again.\n\nAnd Paul says \"No.  Way.  Don't you remember what happened last time.  He abandoned us.  I'm not bringing that flake with us again.  What if we get in a tight spot, is he going to abandon us again.  We are better off without him.\"\n\nAnd Barnabas says \"I really think we should bring him\" \n\nAnd Paul says \"No.  Not going to happen.\"\n\nAnd they Bible says:\n\n> *\"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other:\"*\n\nThey blew up and then they broke up.\n\nPaul picked a new partner - Silas and Barnabas took John Mark and they split up and went different ways and just like that it was over.\n\nNow, this is in the Bible.  It's in there for a reason.  What does God want us to learn from it?  Let me give you six lessons.\n\nThe first one is this:\n\n## 1. Saved people aren't perfect. (even apostles) \n\nIsn't it kind of shocking to see this about the apostle Paul?  We love the apostle Paul.  He is a great Christian man.  Maybe the greatest Christian man in the bible.  \n\nAnd then Barnabas.  Barnabas was such an encourager.  Remember, it was Barnabas who went and got Paul when no one else at Jerusalem trusted him.  When everyone thought he was a spy.  Barnabas was the one who vouched for Paul.  He was the encourager.  The nice guy.\n\nYet, it turns out, both of these guys seem pretty hard headed here.  You would think that after all they had gone through they should be able to work something out - to make some kind of compromise - but no.  They didn't.  They blew up.\n\nAnd to me, this is just a reminder that **the best of men are men at best**.  Nobody's perfect.  Everyone has their lumps.  Everybody has their quirks.\n\nYou here people talk sometimes about \"the perfect church\" - there are no perfect churches because their are no perfect people.  If this church was perfect it stopped being perfect when you got here. I could say that about anybody in here.\n\nYou here ladies sometime talk about finding \"the perfect man\" - mr. right.  But are they Miss right? If they are honest they'd say no.  Nobodies perfect.  \n\nNow, listen - that's no excuse for us to not TRY to be.  That's not to be an excuse.  But it should be our expecation.  David said in Psalm 39:4\n\n> *\"LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.\"*\n\nWe are all frail.  All flesh.  All imperfect.\n\nA second lesson we can learn from this is...\n\n## 2. Conflicts happen. (even with godly people)\n\nMy pastor and boss back in Tennessee served the same church for over 40 years. He would always joke that he had started 8 churches in the Athens, TN area - none on purpose.  Conflicts.\n\nI've met people here.  In Mattoon. Baptists.  Christians.  Who are still mad about stuff that happened 40 years ago.  Conflicts.\n\nConflicts happen.  Conflicts will always happen.  It's part of being a human being.  Anytime you have two people with two wills and you put them together in one place you are going to have conflict.\n\nNow, there are certainly things we can do to avoid conflicts - but we'll never make them go away altogether.\n\nThe third lesson I think we can take from this might surprise you:\n\n## 3. Sometimes both people are right. (even though they can't see it at the time.)\n\nYou see.  Think this through with me.  \n\nLook at it from Paul's perspective: They are doing great work.  It's dangerous.  They are being thrown in jail and risking their life and visiting hostile people.  John Mark has already abandoned them.  It's just not wise to take him with them again.\n\nThat makes sense - right?\n\nNow, look at it from Barnabas' perspective: John Mark is a godly young man. He wants a second chance.  Maybe he needs an encouragement.  He knows what to expect.  He's not going to do it again so easily.  He already knows the ropes.  Aren't we supposed to be \"forgiving one another and forbearing one another?\"  Wasn't it Paul that said that?\n\nThat makes total sense too.\n\nI think they were both right.  Both had good points.\n\nChurch, one of the wisest things we can learn is that when their is a conflict - it's not a zero sum game.  It's not a win-lose thing.  It's not always \"one of us has to be right.\"  Sometimes, both of us can be right and some yielding has to happen. \n\n`<rabbit-trail>`\nCan I veer off subject for a second and say something I think is related and very important:\n\nWe are totally losing the ability to have any kind of conversation in our country.  We've totally stopped trying to compromise with people who don't agree with us. We've totally lost the ability to empathize with others at all and to think about where they are coming from.\n\nLook - we've had a rough week in this country.  The two black men who were shot by police on camera.   We don't know the details yet - but it looks bad. Then the dozen police officers who were shot in Dallas.  We've had the major party nominee absolutely excoriated by the head of the FBI.  We've had mass shootings.  \n\nI remember watching a documentary about the end of the 60s: The race riots, the riots at the conventions, the assassinations - and I thought \"Man, I'm sure glad I wasn't there.\"  Well, we are there now church.  We are there now.\n\nAnd do you know what we need?  Do you know what we desperately need.  We need people who can see others through God's eyes.  Not as democrats or republicans or as blacks or whites, but as people Jesus died for.  As fellow fallen human beings who are right about somethings and wrong about somethings.  As people who need a savior.\n\nSorry.  Rabbit trail over. `</rabbit-trail>`\n\nBack to the point -conflicts are going to happen. Sometimes there isn't a right party.\n\nLet's move on to the fourth point - and from here on out it is a lot more encouraging:\n\n## 4. God is sovereign (Even in conflicts.)\n\nDo you know what happened here?  Two good people had a breakup.\n\nDo you know what else happened in this story?  God took one missionary team and turned it into two.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, this conflict was God's way of moving these people apart so that He could do more with them seperately.\n\nYou know, when an eagle is teaching it's babies to fly - it will take their nest, which is really comfortable, and start turning up the twigs and sticks so that it's uncomfortable to prod them out.  Some people need to do that to their grown children.  \n\nI think God is big enough that maybe He was twisiting some twigs in the Paul-Barnabas nest so that He could better use them both elsewhere.  \n\nLook, you might have to deal with conflicts today and they might not be pleasant but someday you'll be able to look back and sing \"my father planned it all.\"  God is sovereign.  Just trust Him.\n\nThe fifth lesson from this story is just as encouraging:\n \n## 5. When we make mistakes, God isn't finished with us (Even if other people are.)\n\nSo the man at the middle of this story was Barnabas' cousin - John Mark.  John Mark abandoned Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey.  He blew it.  Paul didn't want to go back out with him.\n\nBut this isn't the last we hear about John Mark.  Not by a long shot.  God wasn't done with John Mark yet.  In fact, John Mark had the privilege of penning one of the gospels.  The book of Mark.\n\nLook, sometimes in life we make mistakes.  Big mistakes.  We blow it.  But that doesn't mean God is done with us, it doesn't mean that God can't use us.\n\nIt was after Moses killed an Egyptian man in anger that God used him to write most of the Old Testament and lead his people out of Egypt.  It was after Jacob deceived his father and father in law that God gave him the honor of being called \"Israel.\"  It was after Peter blew it at Christ's crucifixion that he became the leader of the apostles.\n\nPeople might be ready to cast you off - but that doesn't mean God is done with you.\n\nOne more lesson and we'll be done, and I think I've saved the best for last:\n\n## 6. God can put it back together (even after a blowup.)\n\nTo get the coolest part of this whole story you have to turn to the last book that the apostle Paul wrote - when he was very near to dying. Turn to 2 Timothy with me and look at 4:11.  Notice what Paul says here:\n\n> *\"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee:for he is profitable to me for the ministry\"*\n\nHere, Paul is at the end of his ministry.  He's in a jail cell.  He's facing death.  Most people have abandoned him.  Who does he call for?  Who does he ask for by name?\n\nYes. John Mark.\n\nNow listen, how about you?  Is there anybody who you've had a conflict with and the relationship is strained?  It doesn't have to be. God's big enough to fix it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAn old preacher once said\n\n> To dwell above with saints I love, that will be glory.  To dwell below with saints I know - now that's another story.\n\nWe laugh at that - but the truth is conflict is just a part of it.  We are commanded to forgive each other, to forbear each each other, to love each other and help each other - but sometimes we just can't stand each other.\n\nChurch, we just have to trust God to heal those strained relationships.\n\nI heard a preacher say once\n\n> God isn't please with broken relationships.\n\nThat's stuck out to me for a long time.\n\nMaybe you've let someone down.  You've been a John Mark.  You've never apologized.  Let me tell you God can still use you.  He's not finished with you yet.  God can repair that relationship too.  Just trust Him.\n\nMaybe there is someone out there you need to forgive.  Maybe there is someone out there you need to ask forgiveness to.  Take care of it today.\n\nLet me close by saying one more thing.  All of us let someone down - all of us deliberately let down God.  We broke that relationship.  And He loved us so much that He sent His only son to die on the cross for our wrongs, and He wants to forgive us and restore that relationship.  Trust Him today.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attTBvWiOEXESedz5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/deT6FfCS3u4tKXa9Qp5l_2016%200710%20sun%20am.mp3","filename":"2016 0710 sun am.mp3","size":16355328,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","slides":[{"id":"att2sgdEdhLMuicro","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/QPFHZjEsR4yRxze8S7xo_Acts%2015-3%20slides.pdf","filename":"Acts 15-3 slides.pdf","size":18326945,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att2sgdEdhLMuicro-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att2sgdEdhLMuicro-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attRAWpwcDiDy13mD","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/AUFB5VjQMC7WuuPT99zq_Acts%2015-3%20handout.pdf","filename":"Acts 15-3 handout.pdf","size":15548,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attRAWpwcDiDy13mD-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attRAWpwcDiDy13mD-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-07-10","bible_text":"Acts 15:36-41","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

Let's read chapter 15 together:\n\n> *\"1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I [am] thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward. 2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus? 3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 4 And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 7 And he said unto him, I [am] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 8 And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet full. 17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\"*\n\nThis is an interesting chapter.  It's a very important chapter.  It's the basis for much of what we see in the Paul's writings about faith.  \n\nIt's a chapter with a lot of firsts: \n\n* It's the first time in the bible you see the phrase \"The word of the Lord came.\"  Now, you are going to see it a lot later - but this is the first reference to the word of the Lord.   \n* It's the first time in the Bible you see God referred to as a shield.  Again, you see that a lot in the scripture - about 20 times.  We sing about how God is a mighty fortress.  That idea starts  in this chapter.\n* It's the first time that a person is commanded to \"fear not\" in the Bible.  That command appears 63 times in the Bible, more than any other command and it is found first here.\n\nBut probably the most important thing we see first in this passage is the word **\"believe\".**\n\nAbraham is called \"the father of faith\" for a reason.  In the New Testament, when Paul was making his case for salvation by faith he said \n\n> \"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.\"\n\nBelieved.  That's an important part of it.  So this is a special chapter.  We are just going to focus tonight on the first couple verses of it.  We'll probably look at the rest of it next week.\n\n\n***So let's pray and I'll give you three points about it.***\n\nThis chapter starts with God coming to Abraham and saying *Abram, fear not.*\n\nSo, point number 1 -\n\n# 1. The Problem:\n\nAnd the problem was fear.  Fear.\n\nApparently, Abram was afraid.  \n\nNow, humanly speaking, he had good reason to be scared.  Let me give you two of them:\n\n## A. Fear of powerful enemies\n\nRemember what happened in the last chapter?  He took on Chadalaemer - the warrior king.  He, one guy with his small band of soldiers, took on his era's equivalent of Alexander the Great or Napaleon and won.  Chadalaemer must have been steamed and Abraham probably feared that this super powerful guy would come back with a vengeance - wouldn't you?  \n\nBut I think there was a second thing that Abram was fearing at this point in his life and it was:\n\n\n## B. Fear of empty promises.\n\nHold your finger here and turn back to chapter 12.  God tells Abram to get out of Ur and follow Him and Abram does.  He doesn't do it right away. But he does.\n\nThen, in verse 2 look what God says to Abram:\n\n> *\"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:\"* (2)\n\nSo, God had promised Abram that He would make his name great and that He would bless him and make him into a great nation.\n\nThen look down at verse 7:\n\n> *\"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.\"* (7)\n\nHere God reiterates this promise but adds that God would give his seed the land.\n\nAlright, fast forward back to chapter 15.  It's been something like 15-25 years.  Abraham is an old man, Sarah is an old woman and they still have no child.\n\nSo God had promised land to Abram's seed - but at this point Abram is too old and he still doesn't have any seed.  Every promise of God at this point seems like a sham.\n\nAnd Abram is alone in the desert on a starry night mulling all of this over.  Of course he was afraid.  He probably was doubting.\n\n---\n\nSo that's the problem.  Let's look at point 2 -\n\n\n# 2. The answer:\n\nLook at verse 1 again:\n\n> *\"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, \"*\n\nDo you know what I love about this?  God came to Abram.  God looked down from heaven and saw that His child was in a time of need, God looked into the head of Abram and saw what was there and God said \"This man needs some help\" and God came to Him.\n\nGod does that sometimes.  We ought to rush to Him, but sometimes He beats us there.\n\nNotice what God says - these words are powerful:\n\n> *\"Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\"*\n\nHe says Fear not!  \n\nWhy Abram?  Why fear not?  What possible reason do you have to not fear?\n\n> *Fear not, Abram, I.*\n\nHere is the amazing thing.  Fear is the problem in this passage.  Do you know what the answer is?  It's God.  Just God.  The person and character of God.\n\nWhy shouldn't you fear?  Why is fear not repeated 63 times in the scripture?  God.  It's because of WHO He is we can get through trials.  It's Him.\n\nSpecifically, though, God wanted Abram to know two things about Himself. First, \n\n## A. God was Abram's Shield.\n\nDo you know what God was saying there?  You could sum it up in three simple words \"I'm protecting you.\"  I'm watching out for you.  I'm your bodyguard.  I've got your back.\n\nWhen you walk with God you are walking around with the greatest insurance plan you could ever have.  You may be in good hands with All-state but that's nothing like the protection of being in God's hands.  You can walk into war zones in God's will and be totally untouchable.  You can get thrown into a fiery furnace so hot the people who throw you in die of heat and come out unscathed if you are under God's protection.  You can have the armies of this world descend upon you and be totally calm because the armies of God are descending on them and it's no contest.\n\nWe can say like Paul in Romans 8:\n\n> *\"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"*\n\nBecause you are in God's hands.  He is your shield.\n\nThe second thing God wanted Abram to know about Himself was...\n\n## B. God was Abram's Exceeding Great Reward.\n\nNow, Abram was thinking about the promise of God - the land, the children, the nation.  All of that.  But God said to Abram - no \"I am your reward.\"\n\nI love how a preacher named F.B. Meyer from the 1800s put it:\n\n> \"Come now, my child, and think; even if thou wert never to have one foot of soil, and thy tent were to stand silent, amid the merry laughter of childish voices all around -- yet thou wouldest not have left thy land in vain, for thou hast Me. Am not I enough? I fill heaven and earth; cannot I fill one lonely soul? Am not I 'thy exceeding great reward'; - F.B. Meyer\n\nIn other words - listen - even if God gives you nothing else but Himself - He's given you more than anything you could ever even ask for.\n\nMost of the time, God blesses His followers.  Proverbs says *\"I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread.\"*  The book of Luke says *\"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.\"*  Jesus promised his disciples *\"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.\"*\n\nSometimes God's will is for us to go through times of poverty and hardship, but most of the time God blesses those who follow Him.  But listen, if you get nothing.  No financial blessing, nor family blessing.  Nothing besides a walk with God - you've still got the deal of a lifetime.\n\nSo God was reminding Abram of this.  Abram had God.  He had a relationship with God. God was looking out for Him and taking care of Him.  Don't fear, I'm here.\n\n# 3. The promise:\n\nSo Abram listens, and while He's talking to God, He addresses the elephant in the room. He asks \"What about the promise of a child?  You promised me that, and I have no son, all I have is a steward, is He supposed to be my heir?\"\n\nLook at God's answer (in verse 4-6):\n\n> *\"[Gen 15:4-6 KJV] 4 And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\"*\n\nGod said \"No, no, no Abram.  You are getting ahead of yourself. I'm going to give you more natural offspring than you could possibly count.  Look at all of those stars - you'll have more offspring than that.\"\n\nWe know the rest of the story.  God did.  Abram was old - way too old. But God worked a miracle.  \n\nThe lesson from that is this:\n\n> We often mistake God's delays as denials.\n\nSometimes we think God is saying \"No\" when God is just saying \"not yet.\"  \"Wait a little while.\"  Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\n\nAs a parent, sometimes my kids want to know every detail.  When are we leaving, what way are we going, what stops are we making, who are we going to see.  Amanda has a saying, she says \"Ride the bus.\"  That means \"Just trust me, I've got a plan, just go along.\"\n\nSometimes God says to us \"Just ride the bus, the ride might take a little longer than you think it should, but I know exactly what I'm doing.\"\n\nAnd church - never forget this - God knows exactly what He's doing.  His plan for you is perfect.  You might not like every stop on the itinerary. You might have to deal with the cancer stop - didn't plan on that.  Maybe you stop at a place called divorce - didn't want to go there.  Maybe you have to go through poverty - or lonliness - or whatever and you say \"God, are you shure you know where you are going?\" It might not be what you expected.  But ride the bus.  Trust God.  He wants what is best for you and He has a plan for you.\n\nThe last point this evening is:\n\n# 4. The response:\n\nLook at verse 6:\n\n> *\"And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\"* (6)\n\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attZDx1zAP0FuP0tD","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/wzBkLGDSSSDmoOPBUcCw_2016%200710%20sunpm.mp3","filename":"2016 0710 sunpm.mp3","size":28396563,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["receF5EJ1Mtrjz1Ne"],"service":"Sunday PM","handout":[{"id":"att61RZtPKVHEs5Rs","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/jAfLimmrRImwsw6TzElM_Genesis%2015%20handout.pdf","filename":"Genesis 15 handout.pdf","size":14202,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att61RZtPKVHEs5Rs-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att61RZtPKVHEs5Rs-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-07-10","bible_text":"Genesis 15","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"updated_at":"2016-07-16T14:01:00.000Z","published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

If I'm known for anything by pastors outside of our church - it's my writing on this subject.  Depending on who you are - this may make you mad, it may make you rejoice.  I think it steps on everyone's toes.  Today we are going to look at a passage that really speaks to rules - Christian rules - standards if you will - and the reason behind those rules.  \n\nNow, this is a \"thinking cap\" kind of message.  You are going to have to hang on and follow along.  I'll do my best to make it interesting - but it's definitely important.  So try to stay with me.\n\nBefore we get into the passage - let's review the context for a minute.  If you remember from last Sunday, there is a group of people that are going around the world telling gentile Christians that they have to follow the jewish law - they have to eat kosher, they have to observe the sabbath, they have to go through circumcision, etc.  They are saying that you have to do those things if you want to be saved.\n\nThat's heresy.  That's a problem.  But remember - at this time, the vast majority of Christians were from a jewish background.  They were doing this stuff already.  So it was an easy heresy for most of them to swallow.\n\nPaul and Barnabas had a real problem with it and they took their problem to the highest court there was - the church at Jerusalem.  The apostles had a long discussion on it and in the end, their decision was summarized by James in verses 19-21:\n\n> *\"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\"*\n\nThat's where we left off last week.  Today, we are going to continue right there and read verses 22 to 35.\n\n> *\"22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 23 And they wrote [letters] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren [send] greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment: 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell [you] the same things by mouth. 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 31 [Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed [them]. 33 And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.\"*\n\nOur outline this morning is going to be simple.  Basically, two points and some lessons as we look at this passage.  \n\nThe first point is:\n\n## 1. The Test\n\n**The star of this chapter is the commands that James and the apostles give to the gentile churches.**  We see them in verse 20.  Then the rest of these verses tell us how they were carried to the gentile churches.  Then you see them again in verses 29-30.\n\nSo this passage is all about this command we see in verse 20 and in verse 29.  How it was received.  How it was transmitted.  \n\nThe story here is pretty straightforward:  The apostles made their decision, then Paul, Barnabas, and a couple of new names - Silas and Judas, went around telling everyone what the apostles had decided. That's it, that's all we see in this passage.  \n\nSo what I want to do this morning is what I didn't do last Sunday, I want us to take a look at this command that was being passed around, look at what it actually saying and try to understand it.\n\nSo what does verse 20 say Gentile Christians had to do:  Four things?\n\n* Abstain from pollutions of idols\n* Abstain from fornication\n* Abstain from things strangled\n* Abstain from blood\n\nThat's it.  Seems kind of random right?  Let me explain a little.  \n\nThe first part: pollutions of idols - had to do with polluting your house with idols.  Jews hated idolatry and if you had a bunch of leftover idols in your house and a jew came over - they would have thought that was unclean.  So this is basically saying - get rid of all of your old idols.  It also referred to meat that had been offered to idols.  A lot of the food that gentiles ate would be offered to idols first.  Obviously, jewish people would have a problem with that.\n\nThe third and fourth parts: things strangled and blood.  Those are dietary.  The jews wouldn't eat any meat unless it had been drained.  They considered the meat that gentiles ate unclean because it wasn't properly kosherized.  So the gentile Christians had to make sure that their meat met jewish standards.\n\nSo let's recap: get rid of idols, don't eat meat offered to idols, make sure your meat meets jewish standards.\n\nThe last thing is \"abstain from fornication.\"  This doesn't seem to fit.  There are a lot of explanations for it.  But the one that makes the most sense is that the gentiles lived in a very open society.  They lived in a society where fornication, nudity, adultery etc. were very very common.  People joked about them openly.  Most people didn't see a big deal.\n\nIt's like today.  If you poll most people under 40, the vast majority don't think there is anything wrong with living with someone outside of marriage.  They dress to draw attention to their bodies.  They read magazines about it.  The TV and Movies make it seem like nothing.  \n\nThe greek and roman societies were even worse than ours are about that. So what I think this last thing was saying wasn't just \"don't have sex outside of marriage\" what I think it was saying was \"be really careful about the whole subject.\" \n\nSo the logical question is **why?**  \n\nDoes this mean that we are supposed to eat kosher?  Does this mean that we have to clean out our houses? \n\nThe why of this is really important. \n\nThat brings me to...\n\n## 2. The cause\n\nI think probably the most important verse in this whole chapter is actually verse 21.  James gives this command and then he says:\n\n> *\"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day\"*\n\nThe word \"for there\" signifies that what comes after it is a statement of purpose.  It's like James is saying *20* **\"here is what you need to do\"** and in verse *21* he's saying **\"and here's why.**\"\n\nSo here is the why for the command: because in every city there are synagogues full of people who follow Moses.\n\nDid you catch that?  Read the verse again:\n\n> *\"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day\"*\n\nOk, so what does that tell us about this great command?  Here it is:\n\n> This command isn't about **salvation** (believing the gospel) or **sanctification** (becoming Holy) it's about **evangelism** (or testimony with a lost world.)\n\nYou see, the stated point of this wasn't that you had to do these things to get saved - that was heresy and the apostles dealt with that.  It wasn't that you had to do these things to be holy - we are made holy by Jesus Christ.  We are accepted by Him.  We are clean in him.  The apostle Paul explicitly makes this argument both in 1st Corinthians and in Romans.  \n\nSo this verse and this command has nothing to do with our standing before God and everything to do with our standing before our fellow man.\n\nIn other words, If you were a gentile believer living around jews and trying to witness to them - you would have no chance if you didn't do these things.\n\nThe jews were raised to think that gentiles were gross.  That their houses were full of wicked idols.  That their food was idolatrous.  That they ate and touched unclean things.  So you couldn't lead a jew to the Lord if they wouldn't go near you.\n\nThat's what these commands were all about.\n\nBy the way, we aren't under these commands today.  We aren't under the dietary law.  What God said to Peter still works for us - \"Arise and eat.\"  You don't have to worry about kosher.  You don't have to worry about people thinking your house is ceremonially unclean.  That's Old Testament stuff and we live in the new testament.\n\nThat's never what these commands were about - they were:\n\n1. Telling the gentiles they weren't under the law and were saved by grace \n2. Telling the gentiles they needed to be careful for the sake of the jews around them.\n\nAnd that's really backed up by the way these commands were recieved.\n\nLook at verse 31:\n\n> *\"31 [Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.\"*\n\nWhen the gentiles heard this they rejoiced.  We aren't under the law.  Salvation is by grace.  That's a consoling message.\n\nSo we've looked at the command, we've look at the cause of the command.  Now let's talk for a few minutes about...\n\n## 3. The consequences (lessons for us)\n\nWhat in the world are we - believers who live in the 21st century, who live thousands of years removed from the Old Testament, who live removed from all jewish influence. What are we supposed to get from this passage?  What does this teach us?\n\nI think it teaches us three principles that we can apply to our own rules and our own ways of living.\n\nListen, church, rules are a part of life.  We can't live without rules.  We can't live as anarchists.  God instituted authority in the home, authority in the church, authority in government, authority in the home.  There are going to be rules in every aspect of our life.  So how do we parse those rules?\n\nBefore I get into the lessons here, I want to say that there are two bad attitudes people tend to have that are kind of like the two extremes on this:\n\nOne of them is this **\"You have to obey the rules or you aren't saved.\"**  That's the problem that the people in this passage were dealing with and there are still people who have this attitude today.  \n\nBut the second extreme attitude that we deal with is this **We are Christians now so there is no rules.** This is on the other side of the spectrum and we run into this from time to time.  \n\nMost Christians seem to be someone near one of those sides.  So what do we learn from this passage that helps us with this?\n\nI think the first lesson is this:\n\n### A. God is not out to get you\n\nGod isn't a sadist.  He's not into making you obey rules for the sake of obeying rules.  He's not into adding arbitrary rules that you can't handle.\n\nPeter's question in this chapter really gets to this, he asked \"Are we going to put a yoke on the gentiles that we couldn't handle?\"\n\nPeople have a tendency to make rules an end in themselves.  When they do that it hurts people and makes God look like a monster.\n\nRemember what Jesus said in Mark 2:27? He said *\"The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath.\"*\n\nOver time in Israel people got the idea that the sabbath was an end in itself and they made the sabbath, which was something awesome God intended to help people into something awful that was a huge burden.  It got to the point that Jesus was being criticized for healing on the sabbath and the disciples were getting criticized for having a snack on the sabbath.\n\nListen folks - no matter what rule God gives us - God has a reason. He isn't out to get you.  His rules aren't arbitrary.  They aren't \"because I said so\" rules.  Behind every rule is a reason and that reason is almost always for our benefit.\n\nThe second lesson from this is...\n\n### B. God wants people to be saved\n\nSalvation is by grace, through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast. \n\nThe biggest problem that the apostles had with this idea of adding judiasim to the gospel is that it would make it almost impossible for gentiles to trust Christ.  \n\nListen folks - salvation is a free gift that God wants people to take.  Salvation is by grace, not by gauntlet\n\nYou can be saved today.  Just trust Christ and His finished work on the cross and He will save you.  He wants to do it.\n\n1 Timothy 2:4 says\n\n> *\"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth\"*\n\nGod WANTS to save people.  We get this idea in our heads sometimes that people have to run through an obstacle course to get to grace - but that's not how Salvation is supposed to work.\n\nGod wants people to get saved.  But the biggest lesson from this passage is...\n\n### C. We should be willing to do things that aren't necessarily wrong for the conscience of others.\n\nRemember - these rules that the apostles gave to the church - they weren't about salvation or holiness - they were about testimony, they were about evangelism.  Peter and James weren't saying that meat offered to idols was inherently sinful.  They weren't saying that meat with blood in it is inherently sinful.  They were saying \"Listen, there are a bunch of jews who think it is - so for their sake - stay away from it so you can reach them.\"\n\nIn other words, they had to give up things that weren't wrong for the good of others.\n\nCan I tell you - that is God's expectation today too.  You might have something that you think is perfectly ok - but it's not ok to your unsaved family member or some Christian who just got saved.  You don't make fun of those people.  You don't flaunt to those people.  You give it up for their sake.\n\nDo you know there are things that I think are perfectly ok - but I won't do because I don't want to be a stumblingblock.  I'll give you an example: I love hot wings.  I like the food at buffalo wild wings.  I like their food a lot.  But do you know what?  I never go into buffalo wild wings.  Is it because it's sinful? No. It's because I don't want lost person driving out of Walmart and watching me go in there and thinking \"There goes that pastor into a bar\" or I don't want some of you who have been saved recently seeing me in there and thinking \"I guess it's ok to go hang out in there.\"  When it would be terrible for them to hang out in there.  Do you get it?\n\nAs believers we aren't supposed to just live on the plane of right and wrong.  We are to live on the plane of \"is this the best thing I can do for God and others?\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attFTiP1GCzjSq40S","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/pxBATOJrQLymi2efjss2_2016%200703%20sun%20am.mp3","filename":"2016 0703 sun am.mp3","size":29433856,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","handout":[{"id":"attz7QiaFQ9WvYxXN","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/HerMzxhuTQGMvbLiCL0Y_Acts%2015-2%20handout.pdf","filename":"Acts 15-2 handout.pdf","size":23234,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attz7QiaFQ9WvYxXN-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attz7QiaFQ9WvYxXN-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-07-03","bible_text":"Acts 15:22-35","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"updated_at":"2016-07-16T13:32:00.000Z","published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

I'm the kind of guy who, when he gets his value meal at McDonalds with the sandwich missing, says to himself \"I guess it's God's will for me not to eat a sandwich today.\"  I hate arguing with people and asserting myself.  It's actually probably a character flaw and something I need to work on.\n\nThere are some people on the opposite end of the spectrum.  When we were in New Hampshire, I went into a McDonalds to use the restroom and there was a man at the counter who was literally screaming at the workers because they got his egg mcmuffin wrong.  I thought \"dude, it's an egg mcmuffin - it's not worth risking a heart attack over.\"  But he was angry.\n\nSome people love to fight.  They love to argue.  They are always on the lookout for a fight.\n\nThere are some preachers who are that way.  There is this guy in Arizona who pastors a small church about our size and manages to get in the news all the time because he says off the wall things.  After the Orlando shooting last Sunday (was it only last Sunday) he got up on his pulpit and said \"Good\" and then posted it on youtube.  Can I tell you I run as far away as I can from people like that.\n\nWhat we are going to see in our text this morning is a fight.  It's a theological knockdown - draggout bout.  And there are some really, really interesting things we can learn from it that still apply to us today.  So let's read Acts 15:1-21 together:\n\n> *\"1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and [of] the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses. 6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. 7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men [and] brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as [he did] unto us; 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. 12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men [and] brethren, hearken unto me: 14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, 16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: 17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. 18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. 19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood. 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\"*\n\nThis passage is one of the most important passages in the book of Acts and it's all about a fight.  It wasn't a fist fight.  No one was physically harmed.  That was never the intention - it was a fight of ideas.\n\nAll we are going to do is work through this passage this morning, and then I want to give you three lessons from it that we can all apply to today.  Before I get into our outline, **let's pray and ask God's blessing on the reading of His Word.**\n\n---\n\nThe first point in our outline is:\n\n# 1. The Problem\n\nLook at verse 1:\n\n> *\"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.\"*\n\nPaul and Barnabas have been preaching all over the region and there is a group of men from Israel who are going around and they are preaching something new - namely, that you have to be circumcised like a jew if you want to be saved.  \n\nNow, why is that a problem?  \n\nIt's a problem because they are changing the rules of salvation.\n\nWhen I was a kid I played a lot of pickup football at recess.  There was always someone who wanted to make up the rules as he went along.  I'd count my 5 missisippi and then tag the quarterback, and then he'd say \"No, we just changed it, it's ten mississippi now.\"\n\nNothing is more frustrating than when the goal is always moving or the rules are always changing.\n\nBut that's just a game.  Games have very little consequence.  But our salvation is of eternal consequence.  Our salvation is the difference between heaven and hell.  Nothing could be more important. \n\nThere is nothing more important than the question \"What must I do to be saved?\" and if the answer to that question is always changing - then we are in real trouble.\n\nSo these jewish believers come to Paul's area and they start teaching that you have to be circumcised to be saved.  They are adding works to salvation.\n\nLet's look and see what Paul did about it:\n\n# 2. The Response\n\nLook at verse 2:\n\n> *\"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, \"* \n\nThe verse says that Paul and Barnabas sprang to action.  They did something about this false teaching.  They did something about this new doctrine.  Specifically - they had a \"dissension\" and \"disputation\" - what does that mean?\n\nWell, I looked it up and here is what I found.  The word dissension basically means they rose a ruckus.  They made a big deal about this.  They openly resisted this.\n\nThey threw down a flag.  They jumped to their feet and they said \"That's not right - that's wrong.\"  They rose a ruckus.\n\nNow listen to me - too many people are ok with a basketball player raising a ruckus on the court when the call doesn't go his way. They are ok with a politician raising a ruckus when they feel like the government isn't listening to us.  Steph Curry or Rush Limbaugh can contest and protest all they want and no one raises an eye.  But the moment a Christian or a preacher starts saying \"that's not right, that's not fair, that's not what God intended, that's not what the Bible says\"  people get real squirrelly and very uncomfortable. \n\nWhy is that?  Why is it ok to get upset and be vocal about a football game that doesn't matter at all for eternity but it's not ok to get upset and be vocal about false doctrine?\n\nSo they dissented.  It also says they *disputed.*  That just means they had an argument, they had a debate.  They had a battle of ideas.\n\nThese pharisee teachers said \"you have to be circumcised and obey the law to be saved\" and Paul said \"No - no you don't, that's false doctrine and let me tell you why.\"  \n\nBut it doesn't end there.  Look at the verse again:\n\n> *\"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.\"*\n\nThis brings me to my third point:\n\n# 3. The Appeal\n\nYou see, they couldn't just leave this one hanging.  They had to have an answer about this.  They had to know what was right.  \n\nSo they appealed to the highest order they had - they went to the apostles that were at Jerusalem to see what they had to say about it.\n\nAnd that's what most of this chapter is about - it's telling us the story of how that went.  Let me quickly summarize it for you:\n\nPaul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem and they give a kind of missionary report.  Just like when we have missionaries here that show slides and tell about their ministry in Ghana or whatever, Paul and Barnabas went to this Jerusalem church and gave a report of their ministry in the gentile lands and everyone rejoices about it.\n\nBut then, look at verse 5:\n\n> *\"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.\"*\n\nSo this group in the Jerusalem church stands up and they say \"now, hold on a minute - it's good that these gentiles are hearing the gospel and all - but we need to make them get circumcised and keep the law of Moses.\"\n\nLast Sunday we had Dr. Riechman here - and that sure was interesting, and he told us about what \"keeping the law of Moses\" meant to these people.  These Pharisees wanted to say that if you didn't go to synagogue, if you didn't wear the phylacteries, if you didn't eat kosher - then you weren't really saved.\n\nAnd this was a big deal.  Because listen, at this point, almost everyone who was a Christian was a jew.  They kept the law of Moses from birth.  They grew up with prejudices about gentiles.  They grew up thinking they were superior.  So when they saw these Gentiles in the church - they acted like some of you act when someone comes in here that has Tattoos all over them and smells like cigarrettes.  They had the \"ick\" factor and they weren't even trying to hide it - they were trying to spiritualize it.\n\nSo this was a problem.  And the apostles got together and they had a debate.  They had a big argument over it.  There was back and forth.  Finally, Peter stands up and says\n\n\"Listen folks, you remember how a little while ago God made it clear to me that God wanted the gentiles to be saved, and then we saw God work in their lives and give them the Holy Ghost.  God put no difference between them and us.  He declared them to be clean.\"\n\n\nAnd he concludes with verse 10:\n\n> *\"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?\"*\n\nIn other words, let's just leave the gentiles alone.  God is obviously doing something there.  This isn't our idea, it's God's idea.  So let's just leave them alone.\n\nThen they talk some more and James talks and they come to this conclusion that you see in verse 20:\n\n> *\"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.\"*\n\nIn other words - let's not add anything to them. Let's just tell them that after they get saved, they need to avoid idolatry and fornication.  They need to stay sexually pure and stay away from idols.\n\nOk.  So this happened.  We have the record of it.  We can see this theological fight going on here.  What do we learn from it today?\n\nI think there are four lessons that we should learn from this:\n\n# 4. Lessons:\n\nThe first lesson is this:\n\n## A. Some things are worth arguing over.\n\nThere are lots of people today who call themselves Christians who absolutely refuse to take stand on anything.  They say things like \"doctrine divides\" and they talk a lot about \"unity.\"  Their watchword is \"don't ever make a ruckus, don't ever call foul, leave it up to God.\"\n\nCan I tell you church, that might sound good - but it's a cop-out.  It's totally unbiblical.  In the New Testament, whenever false doctrine was taught - especially when it was something about salvation - it was war. The fight was on.\n\nThe book of Jude commands us to *\"earnestly contend for the faith once given to the saints.\"*\n\nPaul tells us that we are to *\"Mark them that cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine that you have learned and avoid them.\"*\n\nIn several places he says about people preaching a false gospel *\"let them be anathama.\"*  In one place the Bible says *\"Don't even wish them godspeed.\"*  In other words, don't even give them a cordial greeting.\n\nPeople don't like that.  It doesn't sound nice.  But make no mistake about this - it's biblical.  It's all over the New Testament.   You can either take a stand for the truth or you can be an unbiblical disobedient Christian.  Those are our options.\n\nAnd let me tell you - the world might not call that nice - but it's really the nicest thing you can do.  When someone is poisoning themselves - they may not want to hear about it - but there is nothing nice about letting them drink poison.  The Doctor in the third world country might not want to hear about anesthetic and hand washing - but letting him go on killing people isn't being nice.\n\nWe have to contend for the faith. Some things are worth arguing over.\n\nThe second lesson I think we can apply to today is:\n\n## B. You can find certainty in apostolic doctrine.\n\nWhen the church had a problem they couldn't answer - where did they look?  They looked to the apostles.  They looked to the teaching of that special group of men that walked with Jesus and they got a definitive answer.\n\n Now, we don't have a group of apostles that we can appeal to today - but we still have the apostles teaching - it's called \"The New Testament\" and we can still appeal to it and to the rest of the Bible to find certainty.\n\nLet me tell you church - the very idea of truth is under attack today.   People say things like \"That may be true for you, but it's not true for me.\"  and \"It's not about the truth, it's about a conversation.\"  Every cultural fight in our country right now springs from an attack on the notion of truth.  And there are people who hate the idea of absolute certainty and absolute truth and absolute moral right and wrong.\n\nBut just pretending like something isn't the truth - doesn't make it stop being the truth.  We have the truth church - it's right here.  One of our baptist distinctives is that this book is \"the sole authority for our faith and practice.\"  When we take a question or a truth to examine it in the light of the scriptures - we are doing exactly what Paul and Barnabas and the believers did in the first century.\n\nAnd we will find certainty here.\n\nTwo more lessons...\n\n## C. Whenever you add something to the gospel you destroy it.\n\nI want you to notice that these false teachers - they didn't take anything AWAY from the gospel.  They wanted the GOSPEL AND JUDAISM.  But by adding Judaism to the gospel, they destroyed the gospel.\n\nDo you know why that is?  The gospel is about the grace of God.  It's a free gift.  It's not of works - lest any man should boast.  It's all God's free gift and none of ours.  Whenever we say \"To be save you have to believe AND\"  Whenever we add that AND we destroy the gospel.  Because the AND makes it stop being a free gift.  \n\nSo the gospel plus morals is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus works is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus church membership is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus culture is no gospel.\n\nIt has to stand by itself, as soon as we tell people there is something they must do ON TOP OF believing the gospel to be saved we fundamentally change what the gospel is.\n\nAnd that brings me to my last lesson:\n\n## D. Salvation is by grace - and we have to guard that with everything we have.\n\nI want to close by having you turn to another passage of scripture.  This is a passage that most likely was written by Paul as a response to this episode in Acts.  So this is talking about the same thing Acts is talking about.  Look at Galatians 1:8-12\n\n> *\"[Gal 1:8-12 KJV] 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\"\"\n\nChurch - the gospel matters.  We've got to get the gospel right and we've got to fight for it with everything we have.\n\n----\n\nMaybe there is someone here this morning that's been hearing about \"the gospel\" but you've never had a time in your life when you believed the gospel and were saved by the grace of God....\n\n\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attF9E0ziV335fYbt","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/aoNuZu9WROF55GcGZJCA_2016%200626%20am.mp3","filename":"2016 0626 am.mp3","size":6774784,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","slides":[{"id":"attqhU5nQ49rt9LXt","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/c5gUMUj0TiqyOSDtnfFN_Acts%2015-1%20slides.pdf","filename":"Acts 15-1 slides.pdf","size":5526586,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attqhU5nQ49rt9LXt-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attqhU5nQ49rt9LXt-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attxC4C90J9CknG5z","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/mfL8p8JQO1zT0ftYEwQk_acts%2015-1%20handout.pdf","filename":"acts 15-1 handout.pdf","size":14924,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attxC4C90J9CknG5z-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attxC4C90J9CknG5z-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-06-26","bible_text":"Acts 15:1-21","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

Saul is trying to kill him.  For seven years he's been on the run.  It's been a rough seven years.  He's worked for several rival governments as a mercenary.  He's lived in caves and in the woods.  He's been betrayed multiple times.  His first wife has married another woman.  He's a fugitive.\n\nDespite this, he manages to get together a band of followers who fight with him and work with him.  They are in hiding together.\n\nIn the last chapter, David and his men are dismissed by the Philistines.  So he and his men have just been fired.\n\nSo that's the backdrop of this: it's like a country music song.  David has lost everything.  He's lost his job.  He's lost his wife.  He's lost his place in society.  He's been betrayed.  He's on the run.\n\n\nAnd when did all of this start for David?  It started in 1 Samuel 16, when David was just minding his own business and the prophet Samuel called him out of the field and anointed him to one day be king of Israel.  So add to all of this, David has the expectation that some day he's supposed to be king.  It certainly didn't look like there was any way that was going to happen here.\n\nNow, with all of that in mind, let's look at 1 Samuel 30.  Remember, they are on the run, they are on their way back to their camp, they've just been fired.\n\n> *\"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; And had taken the women captives, that were therein:they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way\"*\n\n> *\"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite\"* (1-5)\n\nSo here is what they see when they get back to their camp.  A rival army - the Amalekites, have come in when all of the men where gone and burned their camp and taken all of their families into slavery.\n\nSo imagine this - you are already having a rough time.  You've got to go home to tell your wife that you just lost your job.  And you get home and there is no home.  Home has been burnt down, and someone has taken your wife and your kids captive.  \n\nThat's what David and every one of his men experienced in 1 Samuel 30.  Do you know what we call that?  A really bad day.\n\nBut it gets worse.  Look at verse 6\n\n> *\"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters\"*\n\nSo now, not only is David heartbroken, but the only thing he has left - his men - are wanting to kill him.\n\nThis is what you call a really, really bad day. This is some stinky circumstances.\n\nMany of you have dealt with some terrible things, but most of you probably have never had to deal with something this bad.  This is a total loss.  This is pretty terrible.\n\nAnd I think we can learn some lessons from this story for when we are going through stinky circumstances.  \n\n**So let's pray and we'll continue to look at this chapter and I'll give you four things we can learn from this:**\n\nSo four lessons from this chapter.  The first lesson is this:\n\n## 1. When our circumstances stink, God is still in control.\n\nCould we agree that David was at a low point in his life and that he was dealing with some pretty bad circumstances here? Of course he was. \n\nDavid wasn't on the throne.  He didn't have a friend in the world here.  His band of followers had turned against him.  Everything looked as bleak as could be.  But God was still on the throne.\n\n\nIt reminds me of a song we used to sing:\n\n```\nGod is still on the throne, and He will remember his own.\nHis promise is true, He will not forget you.\nGod is still on the throne.\n```\n\n\nGod was still in charge.  Romans 8:28 hadn't been written yet, but God was still working all things together for good.\n\nCan I tell you with certainty - no matter how bad your circumstances - God's still in charge.  \n\n* No matter how bleak it may seem here - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter who is in the white house - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter how much you have in the bank account - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter what the doctor says - God is still in charge.\n\nHe's still on the throne.\n\nSo, when circumstances stink - remember that God is still in control.\n\n---\n\nTo understand the second lesson, let's keep reading in 1 Samuel 30. Look at verse 6:\n\n> *\"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters:but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God\"*\n\nSo what did David do?  Verse 6 tells us - *He encouraged himself in the Lord.*\n\nSo here is the second lesson:\n\n## 2. When our circumstances stink, God is still good.\n\nHow could David encourage Himself in the Lord when everything around him was so bad?  Because God is good. God is good all the time.\n\nLet's look at some psalms for a minute.  Let me read you some:\n\n> *\"Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 106:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 107:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 118:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 136:1)\n\n> *\"Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.\"* (Psalm 119:68)\n\nChurch - God is good.\n\nIt's been awhile since we did this but let's do it together tonight.  I'm going to say God is good - you say \"all the time.\"\n\nReady \"God is good\" -\n\"God is good\" -\n\"God is good\" -\n\nPsalm 145:7-9\n\n> *\"[Psa 145:7-9 KJV] 7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 8 The LORD [is] gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 9 The LORD [is] good to all: and his tender mercies [are] over all his works.\"* \n\nGod is good.  Even when our circumstances aren't good - God is good.  \n\nAnd do you know what - when you can't get any encouragement by looking around - you can always get encouragement by looking up and believing that God is good.\n\nWhen you get the worst news - God is still good and He's still in charge.\n\nIt's really easy to say that when everything is going well - but it's still true when everything is falling to pieces.  God is good.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at the third lesson:\n\n## 3. When our circumstances stink, God is still leading.\n\nBack in 1 Samuel 30 - look what David did next, after David encouraged himself in the Lord, look what He does: (Verse 7)\n\n> *\"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue:for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.\"*\n\nIn the Old Testament, one of the things that God led the people with was through the High Priest's ephod.  It was just a vest, and inside of the vest their were these stones and the people would use them to get direction.\n\nSo David is at the bottom of the barrel and what does he do?  He looks for direction from God.  He goes to the ephod and God gives him instructions.\n\nMaybe, and I don't know here, this is just opinion, but maybe God had to put David here before he saught God's guidance.  I don't know - but God was still leading him.\n\nI remember the first time we drover from Mattoon to Terre Haute.  We were following our GPS, and we found ourselves on this gravel road that looked like it was in the middle of the worlds largest corn field.  There was nothing anywhere and we thought \"this must be wrong\"  but there was one thing that comforted us - that thing was still giving us directions and it turned out it was just taking us the shortest way.\n\nSailors have this saying \"Always be tacking.\"  That means no matter how bleak it looks, always be looking for direction and keeping track of where you are.\n\nYou may be in a terrible spot and life might stink.  Keep following God.  Keep tacking.  Seek His direction and His leadership and He'll help you. \n\nLook, I don't know this, but if you are in a place right now where you feel lost and nothing seems to be going your way - maybe just maybe God put you there so you would finally seek direction from Him.  \n\nKeep seeking God.\n\n---\n\nSo David and his men go after the Amalekites and they get their wives and their families back.  But more than that, they get an enormous ammount of spoil that the Amalekites have stolen.  \n\nDavid went from losing it all to getting more than he ever had in one chapter.\n\nDo you know God can do that?  Your circumstances might stink right now - God can turn them around tomorrow. He can do that.  \n\nSo David takes this immense fortune that he's gotten in one day and do you know what he does with it - he sends a little bit of it to all the elders of Judah.  \n\nAnd in the next chapter, King Saul dies in battle.\n\nAnd in the next chapter, David is made king over Judah.  \n\nAnd here's the thing - all of this happened within days of his total loss at Ziklag, and the events at Ziklag were what led to him being king in Judah.\n\nSo what's the point?  Here's the last lesson and we are done:\n\n## 4. When our circumstances stink, God might be about to turn the page.\n\nGod might be using the terrible circumstances that you are going through to do something amazing in your life.  But you'll never know unless you follow Him, unless you look to Him for guidance, unless you choose to believe in God's goodness even when the circumstances make Him look bad.\n\nI think when David looked back on Ziklag - he didn't see a terrible time - he saw an amazing time.  He saw God come through at Ziklag.  He saw that God had been working all along.\n\nSo church - just trust God.  When the circumstances are great - trust God.  When the circumstances are crummy trust God.  He's still in control. He's still good.  He's still leading and He's up to something.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attbLH35R40TQloyf","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/GHyekZqQRnCtgnQW7Qop_2016%200626%20pm.mp3","filename":"2016 0626 pm.mp3","size":5206016,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["rec3tyk9G6hMIu9lq"],"service":"Sunday PM","handout":[{"id":"attpLXtvpe8Dm9p8E","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/xuTUUe4JSzW8AI2F2Tsk_david-at-ziklag-handout.pdf","filename":"david-at-ziklag-handout.pdf","size":13384,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attpLXtvpe8Dm9p8E-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attpLXtvpe8Dm9p8E-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-06-26","bible_text":"1 Samuel 30","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in:therefore came his father out, and intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad:for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found*\n\nTonight, we are going to finish our little mini-series on the story of the Prodigal Son.  So far, we’ve focused on God’s grace and mercy.  We were the prodigal, and at every point the Father has shown us amazing mercy and grace. That’s the wonderful part of this story.  \n\nBut that's not all of this story.\n\nBut there is one more element, and one more character that we can relate to in this story - and I think he may be the main character - although he usually gets ignored: The older brother.\n\nThe story closes with the older brother, confronting the father.  There is no resolution.  It doesn't close with the Father making up with the older brother.  It doesn't close with the older brother hugging his brother and going into the feast.  It closes with a tension.  It closes in the older brother's court.\n\nWhy is that?  Have you ever thought about why this is such an open ended story?\n\nEvery story has a context and the context of this one is important.  So look with me at chapter 15 verse 1.\n\n> *\"Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them\"*\n\nSo this verse tells us two things about the context of this story.  \n\n1st, it tells us about the **audience** of the story - who was it?  The Pharisees.  \n\nYou do remember who the Pharisees were don't you?  This morning, Dr. Reichman kept talking about the \"hassidic\" jews.  The hassidic jews is the modern day name for the Pharisees.  They were extremely religious people who lived by the letter of the law.  They memorized all five books of the Torah.  Did you notice this morning that, when Dr. Riechman was talking about the sabbath, that he said that they waited until 6:30 to light their candle.  Why 6:30? when the sabbath was over at 6?\n\nAnother thing he said was that in these Hassidic families you often have separate kitchens for meat and dairy.  I asked him why?  There is one phrase in the old testament that says \"don't seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\"  That's it.  It doesn't say \"don't cook meat in milk\" it certainly doesn't say \"keep meat and milk separate\" but the Pharisees have taught that, just to be careful, you have to keep them separated and today, it's gone so far that you have families literally building matching kitchens so they never even have the milk and the meat in the same room.\n\nThat's the Pharisees.  \n\nIt reminds me of an illustration I've heard many times before.  Many times I've heard the illustration of a stage coach and a cliff.  The story goes that a king was looking for a new stage coach driver and held tryouts.  He told the drivers to drive near a treacherous piece of road with a cliff.  The drivers started making it a contest to see who could get the closest to the cliff edge.  But one stage coach rider stayed as far away from the cliff as he could and he got the job.\n\nWhat's the lesson of that story?  Err on the side of caution.  Obeying God's laws aren't enough - you have to go even further.  That's the lesson.  The cliff is seething a kid in it's mothers milk - so the Pharisees wont even eat meat that's been on the same plate as a dairy product.  The cliff is that the Sabbath is over at 6pm, but the Pharisees say \"Let's go to 6:30 just to be safe.\"  Do you get it?\n\nAnd let me just say this - life's not a cliff.  It's more like a bridge.  And if you stay too far from one edge, you'll end up going over the other. \n\nWell, what does this have to do with the older brother?  What does this have to do with the story of the prodigal son?\n\nThe moral of the story is hinted at in verse 1 too.  You see, Jesus was telling this story to confront a problem.  The problem was that the Pharisees were thinking low of Jesus because He was hanging out with publicans and sinners.  He was hanging out with people who weren't church people.\n\nAnd their sneer, their attitude was \"we are better than Jesus because we are separated and we won't hang out with those sinners.\"\n\nAnd in that context Jesus tells this story.\n\nSo, think about it again.  And think about the people hearing it.  They are a religious crowd.  They are extremely observant of all of the religious customs.\n\nThey've been hearing this story about the boy who demanded his inheritance.  I asked Dr. Reichman about this over lunch and he said that the jewish response would have been to stone him.  The pharisees would have stoned this younger brother.\n\nThen he goes off and wastes his living with harlots.  They would have stoned him for that too.\n\nThen he eats from the pig trough - and now it's gone too far.  He is beyond unclean.  \n\nHe is a father-dishonoring, sexually immoral, swine herd.  He's about as low as you can go in the eyes of the Pharisees.\n\nBut then Jesus talks about the older brother.  He's upright.  He never left his father's side.  He's observed all of the rules.  He's been the good son.\n\nIf there was a person in this story who the Pharisees could identify with - it would be this older son.  That was them:  Scrupulous, devout, hard-working.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Jesus was trying to do with this story.  I think He was trying to aim this right at the heart of these Pharisees.  \n\nWhat I want to do tonight is give you four points about the older brother, and as we look at these, remember, this is religious people.  This isn't the guy who is living hard and loose.  This is for the guy who comes to church on a Sunday night.   This is for you.  This is for me.\n\nOk.  So the first thing is...\n\n## The relationship of the older brother - cold and distant.\n\nOne of the obvious things about this story is that the older brother does not have a very warm relationship with his father.  There are several clues to this:\n\nFirst, it would have been the older brother's job to put together a party like this.  This older brother was never included - which probably meant something was up in the family.\n\nSecond, notice the way that he talks to the father and says \"this thy son.\"  There is no respect whatsoever in this older brother.  \n\nThird, when he complains he says \"You never gave me a calf so I could make merry with...\"  who?  The family?  You?  No, my friends.\n\nThis older brother does not have a good relationship with his father.  Not at all.\n\nDo you a lot of religious people might be doing all they can to meet the heavenly father's criteria - but they don't really have a love for their father.  They don't really have a relationship with their father.  There religion is cold and distant.\n\nI think it even goes further here - I think the older brother really hated his father.  He resented his father.  He was just trying to use His father.\n\nWhich brings me to the second point:\n\n## The righteousness of the older brother - based on works.\n\nNotice what the elder brother says to His father:\n\n> *\"Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends\"*\n\nThe word \"serve\" there is actually a strong word.  It carries the idea of \"slaving for you.\"\n\nNow, think about this.  Think about it.  How does this son view his father?  As a slavemaster.  He wants his father's property and he's willing to work for it  but he resents his father and views him as a slave master.\n\nSo the elder brother is really after the same thing the younger brother is after - he's after his father's property - but the elder brother is getting it by works and the younger brother got it by demanding it.  They are both just using the father to get what they are after.  One of them is just doing it in a way society thinks is respectable and other isn't.  But at the heart - it's both the same.\n\nDo you know there are plenty of people who go to church and do good not because they love God but because they love themselves.  They do it because it's respectable.  They do it because it works out better for them.  They do it because it helps their business.  \n\nThey don't love God - they view God like a computer program.  They put in the right things and they get out what they want.  They view God like a gauntlet that they have to run through.  \n\nEver talk to a guy about his job and you ask him how he likes it and he's like \"err - it's a paycheck.\"  They don't love their job - they love what their job gives them - and that's the way many religious people are.  They may be squeaky clean on the outside but they are just that way because they want something and when they don't get it that's when the real them comes out.\n\nIt's works based righteousness.\n\nYou see something else about this older brother and it's true of religious people too. You see...\n\n## The rage of the older brother - hated grace.\n\nThis older brother hated grace.  \n\n## The response to the older brother - mercy.\n\n## The replacement for this older brother - Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attJ9lGyEJNUcWpUM","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/EHBB3lfARLWclZ1MoeWn_2016%200619%20sunpm.mp3","filename":"2016 0619 sunpm.mp3","size":33513638,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recCSWkhDcssIH71H"],"service":"Sunday PM","slides":[{"id":"attpM7NBbsUfcVQpf","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/KA3WBu5iTEKJWuuqGhOK_Prodigal%20Son%203%20slides.pdf","filename":"Prodigal Son 3 slides.pdf","size":23761876,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attpM7NBbsUfcVQpf-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attpM7NBbsUfcVQpf-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attzZs7G5zCnBjk7P","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/dqu4ytR3QhOcFfaTEBEh_3%20-%20The%20Anti-Prodigal%20Handout.pdf","filename":"3 - The Anti-Prodigal Handout.pdf","size":36954,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attzZs7G5zCnBjk7P-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attzZs7G5zCnBjk7P-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-06-19","bible_text":"Luke 15:25-32","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

It's a surprisingly hard question:\n\n> What does the word **prodigal** mean?\n\nAnybody know?\n\nWe've all heard of the story of the prodigal son.  Everybody has heard the word prodigal.\n\nUp until a few weeks ago I would have told you that prodigal means \"rebellious.\"  But that's not what the word means.  If you look it up in the dictionary you'll see that the word **\"Prodigal\"** means\n\n> spending money or resources freely and recklessly; wastefully extravagantt.\n\nSo a prodigal isn't a rebel.  It's a spendthrift.  If I went tomorrow and got a tattoo and a nosering it wouldn't make me a prodigal. I'd be a rebel, but not a prodigal. If I went out tomorrow and spent all of our churches money on a cotton candy machine for VBS, it wouldn't make me a rebel - but I would be a prodigal. So the word \"prodigal\" isn't a word about **submission** - it's a word about **spending**.\n\nI want you to remember that definition, because it's important.  As you'll see, there is more than one prodigal in this story.  That's why I'm calling this series \"prodigals\" not \"prodigal.\"\n\nThis morning, I want us to focus on the prodigal son.  \n\n---\n\nVerse 11 says:\n\n> *\"And he said, A certain man had two sons\"*\n\nHere is what happens in this story.  You have a familiar scene for the time.  You have a wealthy father.  In those days it was customary for the father to give a large inheritance to his children.  It was a big deal.  He would have been a farmer.  Most of his wealth would have been tied up in his land and when he died, he would have broken up all of his wealth into the number of sons he had plus one, and he would have given an equal portion to all of his sons but he would have given his firstborn a double portion.  But none of this would happen until the father died.\n\nSo Jesus says in verse 12\n\n> *\"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me\"*\n\nThis is where the audience of that time would have said \"whoa - he did what?\"\n\nI had lunch with my papa last week.  He's 86.  Do you know what I didn't bring up during the conversation - any kind of inheritance. We talked about the rotary club and his construction projects and my Nana's health but I never mentioned an inheritance and if he brought it up I would quickly change the subject. Why?  That would be ridiculously rude and disrespectful.  \n\nBut Jesus didn't live in 2016.  Jesus was living in Israel in AD 30.  If it's rude today to ask my Papa about an inheritance - it would have been absolutely unheard of in Jesus day.  What this young son did here was the height of rebellion and disrespect.  He could have walked up to his father and smacked him in the face and it would have been less disrespectful.\n\nWhat most father's would have done would be to disown their son for such an act.  It just wasn't done.  It's obvious the kid had no respect.\n\nBut that's not what the father did.  The father gathered up all that he had and gave his son what he requested.  Think about this for a second - that probably meant selling land.  I'm sure everyone in town heard about it.  His standing in society would drop.  But he gave his son what he asked for.\n\nAnd what does this kid do?  Look at the next verse:\n\n> *And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.* (13)\n\nHe went as far away from his father as he possibly could go and he lived as differently from his father as he possibly could and he spent his father's hard work and dignity on...alcohol, loose women, parties - you name it.\n\nSo what do you think of this younger brother?  He's kind of a scoundrel. Right?  I wouldn't want him working for me.  If I was the father I'd be tempted to say \"good riddance.\"  \n\nNow - I want to stop here and I want to make a couple of points of application:\n\nFirst,\n\n## 1. Like the Prodigal son we are ingrates.\n\nOur heavenly Father has taken care of us, He has loved us, He showers us with His blessings all of the time.\n\nWhen we breath we are breathing His air.  When we eat we are eating His food.  When we feel the warmth of the sunshine that comes from Him.  He has been exceedingly good to all of us.\n\nAnd yet there is this innate thing in all of us that looks at God and says \"that's not good enough.  I want more.\"\n\nI want more than your provision.\nI want more than your care.\nI want more than your will.\n\nWhen you look at the garden of Eden this really comes into picture.  Adam and Eve had EVERYTHING.  They lived in a perfect society.  They had no pain, no sickness, no lack.  Perfect companionship. A place of prominence. The whole world was theirs.  They even had a close relationship with God.  And yet - it wasn't good enough.  They wanted more.\n\nEvery time we choose to sin - it's like that prodigal son is coming out and saying \"get me out of here.\"\n\nThe second point of application this morning is:\n\n## 2. Like the Prodigal son we are rebels.\n\nThis prodigal did more than just show a lack of gratitude for His father.  He totally spurned his father's wishes and wanted nothing to do with his father's plans.  He wanted it his own way. He couldn't wait to get away from His old man and He didn't care if He broke his heart in the process.\n\nHe was a rebel.\n\nSo are we.  God offers us purpose - we go our own way.  God offers us provision - no, we are going to do our own thing.  God offers us pleasures - they aren't good enough.  We spurn the Father's rules and we run from the Father's presence because at our heart we are rebels.\n\nJeremiah 17:9 says:\n\n> *\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:who can know it\"*\n\nIsaiah 53:6 says:\n\n> *\"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way...\"*\n\nChurch we are in our hearts wickedly ungrateful and wickedly rebellious.\n\nAnd do you know what we do - we do exactly what the prodigal son does in this story: **We exile ourselves.**\n\nSo, number 3:\n\n## 3. Like the Prodigal son we are exiled.\n\nThe prodigal son goes into a far country.  As far away from the father as he can get and the prodigal son tries to make his life happy and fulfilled with all of the things his father wouldn't let him have.\n\nHe hangs out with the party crowd.  He spends time with loose women.  He's the toast of the town, and most importantly - He is outside of the reach of the father.\n\nWhat a parable for mankind.  The vast majority of the people in this world have exiled themselves from God.  They aren't grateful for all of God's blessings.  They are rebellious against all of God's rules.  They are running as far away from God as they possibly can doing their own thing. Trying to make themselves happy with prestige, with pleasures, with power, with possessions.  \n\nAnd they get it.  They get this fleeting moment of happiness.  They get this fleeting moment of satisfaction.  They enjoy the pleasure.  Remember, there is pleasure in sin for a season.\n\nLook at verse 14:\n\n> *\"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want\"*\n\nThis brings me to my fourth point of application:\n\n## 4. Like the Prodigal son we are unsatisfied.\n\nThe pleasure was real - but it didn't last.  It didn't satisfy.  In fact - it left him poorer.  It left him lonlier.  It left him hungrier.  It left him unsatisfied.\n\nThat's the way the world is.  It promises satisfaction.  It guarantees satisfaction.  Every commercial that we watch is promising it to us.  Every purchase that we make is saying the same thing \"get me and you'll be happy.\"  It promises us satisfaction through romance, through adventure, through leisure, through religion, through sex, through drugs, through alcohol, through partying, through power.  It says to us over and over and over again - just get this and you'll be happy.  Just do this and you'll be satisfied.  Just one more step.  Just one more.\n\nAnd over and over and over again we fall for it.  And over and over and over again we are unsatisfied.\n\nLet me tell you friends - that's the way the world is:\n\n* It promises a party and gives you a pig stye.\n* It promises riches and gives poverty.\n* It promises leisure and gives slavery.\n* It promises companionship and it gives lonliness.\n* It promises satisfaction and it's promises are always, always hollow.\n\nAway from God, people are unsatisfied.  They are conscious of a hole in their life and they are trying anything they can to fill but all they are getting is a momentary buzz, then they have to go on and try something else.\n\nSo, back to our story, this prodigal son has spent everything and now he is in want.  He's lonely, he's hungry.\n\nLook at the next verses: (15-17)\n\n> *\"And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat:and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger\"*\n\nSo this prodigal son - when he reaches rock bottom - finally starts to think of home.  He finally starts to think of his father.  \n\nI don't know but maybe I think at this moment - he has a different view of all of his father's rules.  Maybe he has a different view of his father's character.  \n\nHe is humbled.  And maybe, just maybe for the first time he starts to regret the way he treated his father.  And he starts longing for home.\n\nThe fifth point isn't going to fit in the blank.  Sorry about that. Here's the fifth point:\n\n## 5. Like the Prodigal son we can come to the end our ourselves.\n\nLook, maybe you decided as a young person \"I don't need this God thing - I'm going to go my own way, I'm going to do my own thing.\" and you took God's provision and GOd's life and you went to a far country.\n\nAnd you aren't satisfied.  Let me tell you - you aren't ever going to be.  Why not do what this son did in this story, why not \"come to yourself.\"  Why not think again about the Father.\n\nThis prodigal son came to himself, he looked at the slop he was eating and remembered that his fathers servants fare better than that.  So he came home.  He humbly went home.\n\nCan I give you a sneak peek - this is so beautiful - the father is waiting for his son.  He could have humiliated him.  He could have sent him away.  He could have made him grovel.  He could have laughed him to scorn.\n\nBut that's not what happens. Look at the verse 20:\n\n> *\"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him\"*\n\nThe father welcomed him and accepted him and made him a part of the family again.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point - really the point of this whole thing:\n\n## 6. Like the Prodigal son we can come home.\n\nLet me tell you something - the Father loves you.  He loves you.  He longs to see you return home.  He longs to see you be a part of His family.\n\nHe wants it so much that he didn't just roast a fatted calf - He sacrificed the Lamb of God.  Jesus died on the cross so that you can be reconciled to the father.  He paid your penalty.  \n\nAnd the Father wants to love you and make you an accepted part of His family.\n\nSo here is my challenge for you this morning: \n\nIf you've never trusted Christ as your savior and made a part of the family of God - why not come home this morning?  That slop you are feeding on will never satisfy - come home.  God will accept you with loving arms.  He will run to you if you just come home to Him.\n\nI would love the opportunity to tell you about how Jesus died for your sins and how you can believe on him for Salvation.  Come home.\n\nMaybe you are here this morning and you are saved - but you've grown away from the father.  To you I say the same thing: come home.  The father will welcome you with open arms.  You know that there is nothing worth having in the far country - you know it will never satisfy - you know how good the Father is.  So come home.  Get right with God.\n\nFor the rest of us here is what I think we should do with this passage:  I think we should remember just how terribly we treated the father, how we took his precious substance and we wasted it.  How we disrespected Him.  How we said in our hearts \"anything but God.\"  And yet, after all of our misdeeds and all of our sin - He welcomed us back and made us a part of His family again and He showers us with his love and grace every day.\n\nWe were the prodigal son, praise God we have such a great and gracious Father.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attAETEob7HAX0SSQ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/jWFWUfeTouZKPvCne2eC_2016%200612%20am.mp3","filename":"2016 0612 am.mp3","size":18354176,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recCSWkhDcssIH71H"],"service":"Sunday AM","slides":[{"id":"att8XVF0bgs0KrtqP","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/y6ThZ52aRmyhjg3Jj0Gk_Prodigal%20Son%201%20slides.pdf","filename":"Prodigal Son 1 slides.pdf","size":24541128,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att8XVF0bgs0KrtqP-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att8XVF0bgs0KrtqP-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attLPnEonduSFv9zA","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/pX7SA2PvSPGJGCT2y2rk_1%20-%20the%20prodigal%20son.pdf","filename":"1 - the prodigal son.pdf","size":20600,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attLPnEonduSFv9zA-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attLPnEonduSFv9zA-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-06-12","bible_text":"Luke 15:11-32","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"updated_at":"2016-02-17T14:31:07.000Z","published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

I have a very big and very close extended family.  My cousins were over our house all the time and we got together often.  When my brother Peter got married two years ago in the middle of nowhere Canada, about an 8 hour drive from the border, three of my uncles game and brought their families.\n\nLast week I saw one uncle, my uncle Dave, who I haven't seen in over four years.  He'd never met Noah.  I don't even know if he'd met Molly.  So it was a happy reunion.  When it was time to leave - he came up to me in front of my whole family, gave me a big bear hug and prayed for me out loud right there in front of everyone.\n\nI thought - wow, that was over-the-top.  That was extravagant.  But I also knew it was heartfelt and sincere.  \n\nDo you remember the definition we gave this morning for \"prodigal?\"  \n\n> spending money or resources freely and recklessly; wastefully extravagant.\n\nRemember - prodigal means \"spending extravagantly.\"  It's a word about spending.\n\nIn a sense - what my uncle David did was prodigal.  It was extravagant.  It was over the top.\n\nLook at the Father in this story.  Can I tell you something?  What the Father does in this story is \"over the top.\"  It's \"over the top\" in a good way - but it's still \"over the top.\"  In a sense, the father in this story is a prodigal too.  He is spending extravagantly too.\n\nI want you to do something tonight with me that I think will help you to understand:  lets take the father's actions out of this parable and you put them into real life.  Let's imagine that the father in this story is your neighbor.\n\nSo, your neighbors son comes to him and demands his inheritance now.  He says \"I want what is coming to me and I don't want to wait until you are dead.  Give it to me now so I can move as far away from you as possible.\"\n\nWhat would you expect your neighbor to do?  I don't know.  But I wouldn't expect him to mortgage his house and liquidate his stocks. But that is what the father in this story does.  Isn't that a bit extravagant?\n\nOk, so the son who does this to your neighbor goes as far away from the neighbor as possible and just absolutely blows through everything.  He has nothing left.  He takes his part of your neighbors house - that you know your neighbor paid off one month at a time for a lifetime, and he wastes it on partying and drinking.  \n\nHow would you expect your neighbor to treat his son in that case?  I know what I wouldn't expect.  I wouldn't expect for the neighbor to love his son and miss his son and talk about his son all the time.  You know that guy or lady you know who is always bragging about their kids and their grandkids?  You wouldn't expect your neighbor to act like THAT GUY.\n\nBut what if he did?  What if he talked all the time about when his son was coming home?  What would you think?  Wouldn't you think he was a little \"over the top?\"  Wouldn't you think that was a bit extravagant?\n\nOK, so let's say that this kid who ran away and wasted your neighbors money comes home.  And he comes home broke.  He comes home dirty.  Maybe he's got tattoos all over his body and long nasty dreadlocks and piercings.  But your neighbor - as soon as he sees him runs down your road where everybody can see him and he starts crying and gives his nasty, dirty, smelly son a huge hug and starts kissing his face.  In public!  Wouldn't you say that is a bit \"over the top?\"\n\nBut then your neighbor really lost it.  He gives his son his bedroom back.  He forgives him totally.  He gives him access to the family bank account and decks him out in nice new clothes.\n\nYou'd probably think - if that kid ever came back to me I'd tell him where he can go.  But this neighbor - he just keeps loving on this kid.\n\nBut then the neighbor does one more thing that just baffles you.  He throws a big block party.  He invites everyone in the neighborhood.  He hires musicians.  He buys a lot of food.  He spends thousands, just to celebrate his son coming home.  Isn't that \"extravagant?\"  Isn't that \"prodigal?\"\n\nDo you see what I meant when I said that there is more than one prodigal in this story?  The son was prodigal - he wasted his father's money.  But the father, in the eyes of his neighbors, would have been prodigal too.  His actions were \"over the top\" but in the best way imaginable.\n\nAnd that is a parable about our God.  That's the way our God is to us.\n\nSo let me give you four ways that the father in this story was prodigal, and with each one we'll talk about how our God is prodigal too.\n\nThe first thing I want you to see is that the father showed:\n\n## 1. Prodigal Forbearance\n\nWhen the son in this story demanded his inheritance and disrespected the father - the father would have been within his rights to cut off his son.  You can imagine that happening today - some kid goes to his father and calls him names and demands his inheritance now and the father goes to the lawyer the next day and writes his son out of the will.  But that's not what the father did here - he gave his son what he was asking for and watched sadly as his son went away.  But he never attacked his son or acted vengefully toward his son.  \n\nWhat does that tell you about God?\n\nDo you know there are people in every major city in America that openly hate God.  They mock Him every chance they get.  They pay for big billboards that say things like \"there is no God\" and \"God is not real.\"  They write books like \"the God delusion\" and \"God is not great.\"\n\nAnd do you know what I would do if I were God?  I'd wipe em out.  I'd smush them like the insignificant little bugs that they are. I'd go after every single person who shakes their fist in God's face and I'd make sure they got exactly what they deserve?\n\nBut is that what God does?\n\nNo.  God makes the sun to shine of the evil and the good.  God gives these evil rebellious people plenty of time to repent and turn to Him.  \n\nYou heard about the shooting in Orlando last night. A muslim opened fire in a gay night club and killed about 50 people.  It's the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nHow do you think God views that?  I think a lot of Christians think that that makes God happy.  I don't.  I think God looks at that and He will rightfully judge those people but he would rather they had repented and come home.\n\nGod gives us so much time doesn't He?  He gives us radical, prodigal forbearance.\n\n---\n\nThe second thing we see this father doing is showing:\n\n## 2. Prodigal Love\n\nIn verse 20 it says: \n\n> *\"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him\"*\n\nThe word \"kissed\" there doesn't mean \"to kiss once.\"  This father didn't just give the prodigal son a peck on the cheek.  The word means \"to kiss much, kiss again and again, kiss tenderly.\"\n\nIt wouldn't do disservice to the Bible to read that \"and fell on his neck and kissed him over and over.\"\n\nImagine if you saw a dignified grown man run up to a rough looking twenty-five year old in the middle of walmart and give him a great big hug and just start kissing him over and over.\n\nDo you know what that is?  It's prodigal love.  It's over-the-top love.  \n\nWhen we come to God for salvation we are no less ragged and unlovely as the prodigal son and yet God just loves on us. \n\nA third thing the father showed was:\n\n\n## 3. Prodigal Forgiveness\n\nLet me read you this quote I found in a Spurgeon sermon:\n\n```\n \"Master Trapp says that, if we had read that the father had kicked his prodigal son, we should not have been very much astonished. Well, I should have been very greatly astonished, seeing that the father in the parable was to represent God. But still, his son deserved all the rough treatment that some heartless men might have given; and had the story been that of a selfish human father only, it might have been written that \"as he was coming near, his father ran at him, and kicked him. There are such fathers in the world, who seem as if they cannot forgive. If he had kicked him, it would have been no more than he had deserved. But no, what is written in the Book stands true for all time, and for every sinner,-\"He fell on his neck, and kissed him\"; kissed him eagerly, kissed him much.\"\n```\n\nWhat the son deserved was a beating.  He deserved to be shewed away.  But that's not what He go.  He got forgiveness and restoration.\n\nWhen we came to Jesus for salvation - we deserved God's wrath - we got God's mercy.  \n\nLet me say that again: We deserved God's wrath - we got God's mercy.\n\nDo you know what I think, I think the father didn't need to hear about all the son had done in the far country - I think he forgave him of all of it from the very first moment.  He forgave radically.  Prodigally.\n\nThink about this people - what does that say about our God?  What does it say about the lost world?  God is able to save to the uttermost and He can save the guttermost.  I don't care how filthy, how vile, how wicked people are - they aren't outside of the bounds of God's mercy and God's forgiveness and they can be new creatures in Christ.\n\nThis goes back to one of our assertions this year: \nGod wants to save people.\n\nWhen you go to Denny's and you see the guy with the tattered jeans and the vile t-shirt and the tattoos all over him - try to remember that God wants to save that guy and would welcome him into His arms and forgive him freely.\n\nWhen you go to EIU and you see the two ladies with butch haircuts holding hands, try to remember that God loves those people and desperately wants them to come home to Him and would give them prodigal grace and forgiveness if they do.\n\nSo the father showed, prodigal forbearance, love and forgiveness.  ONe more thing:\n\nThe Father showed:\n\n## 4. Prodigal Grace\n\nLook at verse 22:\n\n> *\"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry\"*\n\nLet me tell you - that's not a small gift. A ring, the best robe, shoes - that was really, really expensive stuff.  But killing a fatted calf and making a party - that was really, really expensive.  This could have costed thousands.\n\nI remember when my sister got married - I saw the cost for the reception.  Yep.  Not looking forward to that.\n\nThis is over-the-top.  It's prodigal. Many would say it's wasteful.\n\nBut I think it's grace.  Grace means \"unmerited favor.\"  It means \"getting something you don't deserve.\"\n\nLet me remind you that God gives us so much that we don't deserve through Jesus Christ.  He showers us with Grace.\n\n","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attutxzVV64xI0tiu","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/OUoDxtG2ThkzXqDbo5wQ_2016%200612%20sunpm.mp3","filename":"2016 0612 sunpm.mp3","size":17711104,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recCSWkhDcssIH71H"],"service":"Sunday PM","handout":[{"id":"attLbaBBvQdofw5Rw","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/ONg8CQQRh2YXj9fkPcTu_2%20-%20the%20prodigal%20father.pdf","filename":"2 - the prodigal father.pdf","size":16178,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attLbaBBvQdofw5Rw-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attLbaBBvQdofw5Rw-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-06-12","bible_text":"Luke 15:11-32","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"updated_at":"2016-06-18T14:31:00.000Z","published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

You let me know at the end if you've figured out what movie this comes from?\n\n```\nCourage! What makes a King out of a slave?\nCourage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave?\nCourage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk, in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?\nWhat makes the muskrat guard his musk?\nCourage! What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?\nCourage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder?\nCourage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the \"ape\" in apricot?\nWhat have they got that I ain't got?\nCourage!\n```\n\nWhat movie did it come from?  That's right, the Wizard of Oz.\n\nI read you that because today's message is a message about courage.\n\nWe live in a trying time.  The world is turning sharply against the message of the gospel.  They never really liked it - they always have held Bible believing Christians in scorn - but they are very, very vocal about it now and growing more so all the time.  They are beginning to, more and more, push anti-biblical and frankly anti-common sense ideas.  This whole transgender bathrooms thing is a good example. There was some news this week about adult strollers.  Yes - you heard that right.  Not for handicapped people.  Just for adults who want to be kids again.  There are people out there who \"self-identify\" as a six year old, even though they are fully grown.  Trans-toddlers I guess you would call them.  It's absurd.\n\nBut it's also accepted and more and more it's going to be mandated.  So what is a Christian to do?\n\nI think we ought to speak out boldly against it.  We ought to be loving.  We ought to remember that these folks that are pushing this stuff are souls for whom Christ died and they are just manifesting different symptoms of the same sin we all struggle with.  But we have to speak out for truth.\n\nBut here is the thing you have to understand: When you speak out for truth when it's not popular - their will be consequences.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  If you take an unpopular stand - it you won't be popular.  If you tell the emperor that his new clothes don't exist, you might end up in prison.  Some people will believe you - some people will despise you.\n\nIf there is one message, one truth, that has always been unpopular, that has always made people angry - it's the gospel of Jesus Christ.  \n\nListen, if you boldly share the gospel of Jesus Christ - there will be consequences. But there will also be miracles.\n\nIf we are going to share the gospel as we ought to, it's going to require courage.  \n\nOur story this morning is a great example of that.\n\n---\n\nTake your Bibles and turn with me to Acts 14. Acts 14.  We are going to look at almost all of the passage today.  This is the last real story in what was Paul's first missionary journey - and it's an interesting one.duc\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nWe are going to read 7 chapter 14 verses 1-20.\n\n> *\"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. But the multitude of the city was divided:and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: And there they preached the gospel\"*\n\n> *\"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: The same heard Paul speak:who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them\"*\n\n> *\"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city:and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe\"*\n\nThe title of the message is \"When they throw rocks.\"  \n\nI listen to a political commentator named Ben Shapiro a lot.  I first heard about Ben Shapiro because of some things that kept happening when he visited college campuses.  He'd get invited to speak by some college group and then people would protest.  They would shout at anyone who tried to get in.  They would go into his meeting and yell.  They would pull the fire alarm.  People that actually want to go to the meetings have to find an alternate entrance because, often, protesters will block the door.\n\nNow, this guy is a pretty level headed guy.  He's not a skinhead.  He's not a Nazi.  He's not a racist.  He just says common sense stuff and some of it isn't politically correct and so his detractors will do almost anything to shut him up.\n\nBut they've never thrown rocks.  They've never tried to kill him.\n\nIn the story this morning - Paul deals with all kinds of opposition - culminating in him being stoned.  A mob literally through rocks at him until they thought he was dead.\n\nLet's see why.  I'm breaking down my message this morning into three parts:\n* What the haters do\n* What the courageous do\n* What God does\n\n**Let's pray and then get into this story:**\n\nThis passage takes place in three cities.  First Paul travels to Iconium\n\nHe does in Iconium exactly what he did last week in Antioch of Pisidia.  He goes into the synagogue and he preaches the gospel.  He tells people about Jesus and how Jesus died to save them.\n\nAnd He has the same results.  A great multitude believe.  That's awesome.  Praise the Lord.  That's a great multitude who will be in heaven.  Who will have Christian homes and raise Christian kids.  That's fantastic.\n\nBut not everyone liked it.  In fact, some people hated it.  Look at verse 2:\n\n> *\"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.\"*\n\nSo, let's look at our first point...\n\n# 1. What the haters do\n\nand the first thing they do is:\n\n## They reject the truth.\n\nNotice this - some people believed - some people resisted.  To some people it was the greatest news they had ever heard but to others it was fighting words.\n\nThere are going to be people who, when they hear the gospel, get angry.  Get mad.  It's the best news in the whole world - but most who have heard it rejected it.\n\nThat's what many of these people in Iconium did, but they went beyond just rejecting the truth, they...\n\n## They slandered the truthful\n\nThey did something about it.  \n\nThey went around spreading lies about Paul and Barnabas.\n\nThis has always been one of the Devil's favorite tactics.  You know, in the early church the Romans believed all kinds of crazy things about the Christians, including that the Lord's supper was a human sacrifice.  THey thought they were political revolutionaries.  Crazy and unbelievable stuff.  But people said it about them and some people believed them.\n\nSlander.\n\nDo you know if you take a bold stand for God - some people won't like it?  Some people might even say some untrue things about you. They might even say you've joined a cult.  They might call you names.  They might even run around with their fingers in their ears and shout nanna-nanna-boo-boo.\n\nSeveral years ago there was a push to kick Chick-fil-a off of the Eastern Illinois campus because, in their words \"it didn't fit their values.\"  I wrote an article in the paper and I said basically - that if you go down this route - where does it stop?  \n\nWould you believe that a few weeks later, there was an article in the paper about me?  Someone who I've never met called me all kinds of nice names like false prophet and bigot.\n\nLook - if you are going to preach the gospel and take a stand for the truth not everyone is going to like it.  Some people will hate it.\n\nThat's part of it.\n\nBut in Paul's case, it went beyond slander.  They moved from slander to:\n\n## Threats\n\nLook at verse:\n\n> *\" And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe\"*\n\nThe slander didn't work well enough.  People were still believing the gospel and getting saved.  So the enemies of the gospel ratcheted it up a notch and started planning to stone Paul.\n\nNow notice - it mentions the rulers here.  There were some powerful people in on this.  And they are making plans.  They are conspiring.\n\nChurch - let me tell you that if you stand for the truth - no matter how lovingly - there may be people who conspire against you.  You may be passed up for a job promotion.  You may be ruled out in public service.  It may be worse.\n\nSo Paul so how serious this was and he decided it was better for him and Barnabas to leave.  No shame in that.  So they went on to Derbe and Lystra.  These were nearby cities, but outside of the governmental reach of Iconium.  It would be like going from Mattoon to Terre Haute.  \n\nAnd what did they do in Derbe in Lystra - the same thing they did in Iconium, the same thing they did in Antioch of Pisidia - they preached Jesus.\n\n---\n\nNow, there is an interesting story here.  I'm not going to get into it very much. But when Barnabas and Paul were preaching in Lystra, they healed someone and due to some local tradition, they were mistaken as gods.  They even had the local priest come out and try to offer bulls to them.\n\nSo immediately their message changed to \"we aren't God's but let me tell you about God and His son Jesus\"  \n\n---\n\nThis brings me to the fourth thing that the haters sometimes do.  Sometimes...\n\n##### They hurt\n\nIn Lystra, some of the people from Iconium caught up with them and started making trouble and telling lies there and this time - they did stone Paul.  They literally got a mob to pick up rocks and throw them at Paul until he was dead (or at least they thought.)  Then, because they didn't want to get in trouble, they dragged his dead body outside of town.\n\nNow, Paul wasn't dead. We'll get to that in a second.\n\nBut here is the point - sometimes the haters do hurt you.  Sometimes it goes beyond threats. \n\nWe support a missionary named John Leonard.  Brother Leonard was starting a church in one of the worst slums in Brazil.  God was blessing. People were getting saved.  Lots of people.\n\nWhen those people got saved, they stopped buying drugs from the local cartel.  They stopped putting money in their pockets.  So after enough of this went on the cartel put a hit on John Leonard's life and one day, outside of their church, a hit man walked up to John Leonard and shot him multiple times and left him for dead.\n\nSometimes, if you serve Christ, people will hurt you.  Real violence can happen.  We are fortunate that it doesn't happen here in AMerica very often but it could.  \n\nSo what do the haters do?  Everything they can to hurt the message of Jesus Christ.\n\nBut let's move on and look at...\n\n# 2. What the courageous do\n\nWhat did Paul and Barnabas do in this harsh opposition? I want you to see three things:\n\nFirst,\n\n## They keep speaking the truth in the face of lies.\n\nI love verse 3, Paul and Barnabas are getting lied about.  They are getting slandered.  Threats are starting to come in. And what is their response?  Look at verse 3:\n\n> *\"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands\"**\n\nThey didn't run from trouble - they tried to teach their way out of trouble.  They knew they had the truth so they just kept preaching the truth and telling people what God had said.\n\nThe old preacher John Wesley used to say \n\n> \"Always look a crowd in the face\"\n\nYou can do that when you have the truth.  You aren't afraid of scrutiny - you invite it.  You aren't afraid of questions - let them come - you'll answer them.\n\nDo you know what I want to do when people are saying nasty things about me?  I want to get out of there.  I want to run.  But that's not what Paul did.  He kept on preaching.\n\nI think a second thing we see that he did and that courageous people do is....\n\n## They keep trusting the God they can't see in the face of the enemy they can see.\n\nThis is amazing faith.  You have an angry crowd of people around you and they are threatening you and they are lying about you and they are trying to shut you up.  That's scary.\n\nBut Paul and Barnabas just trusted God.  They trusted God's truth to do it's work.  They trusted God's power to back them up.  They trusted God's calling on their life.  They trusted God.\n\nI was listening to a lecture this week about Martin Luther.  We don't agree with everything Luther did or said, but their is no doubt he loved God and was used to open the doors of true salvation for many, many people.\n\nWhen Luther was on trial before the Pope's court - he could have lost his life.  He could have been mercilessly tortured.  Many people before him had.  He was before the most powerful forces on this earth.  But do you know what he said, he said\n\n> Here I stand, I can do no other. So help me God.\n\nIt takes faith to trust God when you are going through the valley of the shadow of death.  It takes faith to trust God when the enemies are hurling their darts and sharpening their teeth.\n\nBut it's not a foolish faith - because no matter how powerful the enemies may seem they aren't more powerful than God.\n\nLet me show you one more thing that the courageous do:\n\n# They keep going in the face of more.\n\nWhen Paul and Barnabas hit the wall in Iconium, they went to Lystra for more of the same.  What's amazing is what we see at the end of the chapter.  Paul got stoned.  Not Bob Marley stoned.  Literally bludgeoned to the point where everyone thought he was dead.\n\nAnd what does he do?  Look at verses 19-21.  These are some of the most amazing verses in the Bible:\n\n> *\"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city:and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch\"*\n\nPaul gets up when everyone else thinks he's dead and he go's right back into the city where he was stoned.  Then he goes right back to preaching the gospel.  Eventually, he even visits these cities again where so many people hated him.\n\nHe kept going.\n\nHold your finger here and turn with me to Acts 20 for a second.  Acts 20.  Look at verse 24.  This is Paul talking about all that he's gone through for the gospel and look what he says in verse 24:\n\n> *\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God\"*\n\nThat's courage.\n\nI told you about John Leonard getting shot.  He's paralyzed from the waste down.  Do you know where he is today?  He's in a slum in Brazil preaching to people from a wheelchair.\n\nListen folks, keep serving God.  Keep standing for the truth.  If it's hard keep going.  If they throw rocks keep going.  Don't let the darkness put the light out.  Keep it shining bright for Jesus.\n\nThere is one more thing I want to show you before we close and that is:\n\n# 3. What God does\n\nWe've seen what the haters did and what the courageous did.  Let's see what God did here.  Let me quickly go through this:\n\nFirst,\n\n## God empowers\n\nGod empowered Paul and Barnabas to preach in the middle of opposition. He empowered them to even do miracles to back up his word.\n\nYou know there is this old saying \"God will never give you more than you can handle.\"  It's poppycock.  It's ridiculous.  God gives us more than we can handle all the time.  But do you know what - he's there to handle it with us and there is nothing He can't handle.\n\nSo God empowers.  God empowers you to speak in the first place.  He empowers you to keep going when it get's tough.  He empowers you to be bold in the face of enemies.  He empowers you to get up when they knock you down.\n\nBut that's not the greatest thing that happens in this passage.  The greatest thing is...\n\n## God saves\n\nHere is the greatest thing about this story - everywhere Paul went and the gospel was preached - people got saved.  Even when the enemies were hurling rocks and throwing lies - people were believing the gospel and having their lives changed.\n\nSo I ask you - was it worth it?  Was it worth the lies and the danger and the violence?  \n\nSouls are in heaven today that would be in Hell.  I'd say it's worth it.\n\nLet me read Paul's statement in Acts 20 again:\n\n> *\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God\"*\n\nPaul looked back at all this and said - I finish my course with joy.  I get to tell people about Jesus and see Jesus change their lives.  Yes.  It's worth it.\n\nChurch - in open Antioch - the gospel works.  In pagan Lystra - the gospel works.  in violent Brazil - the gospel works.  In communist China, the gospel works.  In Godless china - the gospel works. In Mattoon, Illinois - the gospel works.\n\nWill it take courage - yep.  Will their be consquences - you betcha - but one of those consequences will be people getting saved.  That's worth it.\n\nLet's stand and pray.","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attVKbjUnJtlLfj4N","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/em6AsYKlR0CWAtQbfy61_2016%200522%20sun%20am.mp3","filename":"2016 0522 sun am.mp3","size":34024802,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","handout":[{"id":"att6fHxQQxB7cKnjK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/FRlJQxlFRPWDxlymRBm5_Acts%2014%20handout.pdf","filename":"Acts 14 handout.pdf","size":13705,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att6fHxQQxB7cKnjK-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/att6fHxQQxB7cKnjK-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-05-22","bible_text":"Acts 14:1-20","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

It's a basic message - really simple.  But I think it's practical.  I think it's something we need to know.\n\nI'm going to let Adam continue in Genesis while I am gone.\n\nLet's read Acts 14:21-28.\n\n> *\"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting then to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation aenter into the Kingdom of God.  And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom thy believed.  And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.  And there they abode long time with the disciples.\"*\n\n\nThis passage is a kind of summary passage.  It tells us that Paul went to a few other places and then went back and visited the places where they had preached.  It's Paul and Barnabas's missionary journey in reverse.\n\nBut here is the idea, the one idea that you get from these verses - everywhere that Paul went - he left a church.\n\nIn fact, Paul wrote one of the books of the Bible - Galatians, right after this to these people.  Turn with me to Galatians 1.  Hold your finger here and then go there.\n\nLook at verses 1-2:\n\n> *\"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia\"*\n\nNotice that last phrase of verse 2: *\"To the churches of Galatia\"**\n\nEverywhere Paul has been would be considered \"Galatia\" and he was only in these places for a short time - just a few weeks or a few months - but he left behind churches.\n\nEver read \"Hansel and Gretel\" - you know how as they journeyed through the woods they left breadcrumbs.  Paul is journeying through the whole world and he's dropping churches everywhere he goes.\n\nNow, that should tell you something - and I think we'll make this our first point:\n\n## Christians need church\n\nChurch isn't some something that was made up to take up everyone's time. It's not an optional part of the Christian life.  Paul went around and preached the gospel, and as soon as he had converts he organized churches.  And when he went back through he wasn't visiting individual converts he was visiting individual churches.\n\nYou know, there are some people who think that the church is some kind of social club.  Or that the church is some optional add-on to the Christian life.  They want to buy the whole Christ thing, but they don't want to add the church package - because they don't want to make the weekly payments.  That's not how this works. \n\nSo that's the first thing I want you to see.  That Paul left churches because Christians need churches.\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy and I realize it - but it's mostly true.  You play baseball in the context of a field.  You are an astronaut in the context of outer space.  You live the Christian life in the context of a local church. \n\nSo Paul left all of these churches.  Ok.\n\nAll right, so I want you to think about this for a minute.  It's Ad 45 or something like that.  There are all of these baby churches that have only had Paul with them for a short time. In many cases Paul had to leave them early because of persecution. They are spread out all over the place and can't really fellowship with each other.\n\nThat's kind of a scary spot don't you think.  I mean - these churches are babies.  If I were to take Noah tomorrow and just leave him somewhere along the interstate in central Ohio to fend for himself - that would concern you wouldn't it?  That's almost what was going on with these churches - they were at best toddlers and they were being left to fend for themselves.\n\nSo we know that Christians need churches - what do churches need?\n\nThat's why I wanted to preach on this passage because it gives us three things - three tools that the church has at it's disposal.  \n\nLook again at our passage.  Verses 22-23 give us a kind of overview of how Paul handled these baby churches and what he trusted.  Look at those verses again:\n\n> *\"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed\"*\n\nOk, so here is my main point tonight.  My main point is that Paul could leave these churches as baby churches because they had three things.  These are the three things that churches need to stay healthy. They are three things that modern established churches need too.  Ready:\n\nThe first thing churches need is...\n\n## Apostolic Teaching (The Scriptures)\n\nPaul was an apostle, and as an apostle he gave guidance to the early church.  He went about confirming and exhorting the people.  He told them to continue in the faith - which refers to the teaching he gave them.  They needed his guidance.\n\nNow - you might be thinking - Pastor, we don't have apostles today. We don't have someone giving us this kind of apostolic teaching.  You are right.  We don't.\n\nBut we still have access to apostolic teaching.  Apostolic instruction for the church.  Do you know what we have?  Every book of the New Testament is recorded apostolic teaching.  We are reading apostolic teaching now.\n\nListen - the first thing that churches need is the Bible.  They need the New TEstament.  They need to be Bible churches.\n\nWhen Paul wrote a letter to an early pastor - his instruction was clear \"Preach the word.\"  More than programs, more than nice buildings, more than technology - more than any of that what churches need is the Bible.  They need the Bible.\n\nLook - there are much more exciting ways to speak to you than going through the Bible like we do here.  I could make up themes and topics - I do sometimes - and we could have a steady diet of just that and we could really ramp it up.  Or we could bring in some dynamic guy to get everyone jazzed up every week with funny stories.  But the main reason we don't do that, other than I just couldn't pull it off, is because that isn't what you need.  You need the scriptures.\n\nThere are a lot of churches today that I think have gone to the point of license.  They have nothing about them that identifies them as believers.  They live and act just like the world around them.  I don't think that's a good thing.  Do you know what they need?  They need the Bible.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are churches that are legalistic.  They are all about the rules.  They've got rules for everything. I was listening to a video the other day and the pastor was just going on and on about rules for this and rules for that.  I don't think that's how God intended them to live the Christian life.  But do you know what they need - they need the Bible.\n\n1 Peter 2:2\n\n> *\"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby\"*\n\nPeople need the Lord but people need the word.  That's how Christians grow.\n\nSo these churches had apostolic teaching and we have apostolic teaching.\n\nThe second thing these churches had was...\n\n## Elder Oversight (The Pastorate)\n\nNotice what the text says:\n\n> *\"And when they had ordained them elders in every church\"*\n\nThe second thing that Paul could trust as he left these baby churches alone was what this passage calls \"elders.\"  But these aren't \"elders\" in the sense that they are old.  You don't have to be ordained to be an old person.  These are the pastoral leadership of the church.  Sometimes they are called \"elders\", sometimes they are called \"bishops\", sometimes they are called \"pastors.\"  It's the same group of men, and actually, elder is the most common name in the New Testament. \n\nTurn with me to the book of Titus.  Titus 1. Look at verse 5:\n\n> *\"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee\"*\n\nThis is a common thing.  They would start a church and immediately they would ordain the leadership of the church. The elders.  \n\nTurn to 1 Peter 5.  With me.  We'll look at verses 1-3:\n\n> *\"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away\"*\n\nSo we get a clearer picture of who these guys were.  They were the undershepherds.  They were to feed the flock.  They were to take oversight.  They were to lead by example.  They were pastors.\n\nListen, this is going to sound totally egotistical but I don't mean it to be.  Because I'm not indespesible as your pastor.  Ok.  But here this:  A church isn't a healthy church unless its:\n\n1- A Bible led church\n2- An elder led church\n\nThose are two safeguards and provisions God has given to the church.  The Bible and pastors.  So if a church is going to be healthy they need the Bible and pastors.\n\n---\n\nBut there is one more thing.  Look at verse 23 in our text one more time:\n\n> *\"they commended them to the Lord, on whom thy believed.\"*\n\nSo how could Paul just leave these baby churches?  They had Apostolic teaching - they had the Bible.  They had Pastoral leadership.  But there was one more thing they had, and it's something we overlook.  They had:\n\n## Divine Faithfulness (The Holy Ghost)\n\nListen to me.  Here this.  Please hear this.  God loves Bible Baptist church far more than I ever could.  Far, far more.\n\nEphesians 5:25 says:\n\n> *\"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it\"*\n\nJesus loves the church.  If what we have here is a true church - God is going to look out for it.  God is going to take care of it.\n\nOne of the most arrogant things I hear pastors say from time to time is \"This church needs me - I don't know what would happen to this church without me.\"  Ok - I get where they are coming from. Churches do need pastoral leadership - but God cares more about that church if it's a true church than that pastor ever could and God is looking out for it.\n\nChurches, if they are made up of believers, are made up of people who have the Holy Ghost living inside of them - and God will lead them.","sermon_mp3":[{"id":"attSX40dPob0qQMEw","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/bcOkgIJDSYOenuM2GDzX_2016%200522%20sun%20pm.mp3","filename":"2016 0522 sun pm.mp3","size":22089977,"type":"audio/mp3"}],"series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday PM","handout":[{"id":"attgL3iT9SYacjfeQ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/uNsG0YOT6SEg2IuyTIbQ_Acts%2014-2%20handout.pdf","filename":"Acts 14-2 handout.pdf","size":16668,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attgL3iT9SYacjfeQ-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attgL3iT9SYacjfeQ-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-05-22","bible_text":"Acts 14:21-28","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.

So I watched it with them.  It was cute.  Peabody of course is this genius dog, and Sherman is his adopted son and the story revolves around Peabody's signature invention \"the way back machine.\"  A Time machine.\n\nImagine if you had a \"way back machine\" - what would you want to see?  The Boston Tea Party?  The signing of the declaration of independence?  Martin Luther nailing the 95 thesis to the Wittenberg door?\n\nI know what I would want to see.  I would want to hear the sermons of many famous preachers who have gone on to be with the Lord.  I'd go to London in the 1860s and hear Charles Spurgeon preach. I'd go to Chicago in the 1950s and hear Harry Ironside.  Maybe while I was there I would zip across town and listen to Bob Ketcham preach.  I'd want to see D. Martyn Lloyd Jones in London and Harold Sightler and Vance Havner and A.W. Tozer. Maybe I would even go way way back and hear Jonathan Edwards or George Whitfield.\n\nBut I know two preachers I would definitely want to hear: Jesus and the Apostle Paul.\n\nWe think of the apostle Paul as a preacher, and we should, but do you know that there are only two full length sermons from Paul recorded in Acts?  We are going to look at one of them tonight.  \n\nTurn with me to Acts 13 one more time and we'll look at one of those sermons.  We've already studied this chapter twice, but we skipped over this part.  Let's read verses 16-41\n\n> *\"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. And afterward they desired a king:and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption\"*\n\n> *\"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you\"*\n\nWe can't hear the Apostle Paul preach.  Even if we could, we wouldn't understand it, because he was preaching in Greek and none of us speak Koine Greek.  But we can read what he said.\n\nSo what did Paul preach when he got this great opportunity.  He preached three things, and they are all things we need to still be preaching today.  \n\nLet's pray and I'll give you those three things:\n\n\nThe first thing that we see that Paul preached is...\n\n# 1. Paul preached the Bible.\n\nNotice that...\n\n## His message was a Bible message.\n\nI want you to notice that Paul went through the scripture with this message.  He was just preaching what the Bible said.  In verses 16-23 Paul gives a summary of the whole of Old testament history - up until David.  \n\nPaul was no dummy.  Even secular people who look back at the apostle Paul recognize that the man was brilliant.  He could have used any argument that he wanted to.  He could have gone to philosophy, to current events, to history, to science.  You know from the Bible that Paul knew all of that stuff - but he didn't - he went to the scripture and he drew his message from the scripture.\n\nChurch - listen to me.  It is not the job of the preacher to make you feel good.  It is the job of the preacher to tell you what God's word says.  It's not my job to get up here on Sunday morning and preach to you from Time Magazine or from Reader's Digest.  It's not my job to preach to you about politics or current events.  It's not my job to give you pop psychology. It's the job of the preacher to say \"thus saith the Lord\" and the only place that we can find that is in the scripture.\n\nLook - I have opinions.  I have lots of opinions.  But you don't need my opinions - you need the word of God.  I could tell you stories till you were sick of hearing them - but you don't need stories, you need the word of God.\n\nWhen you judge a sermon - don't judge it by how it made you feel.  Don't judge it by how dynamic the speaker was.  Don't judge it by how much he yelled and screamed and stomped his feet.  Don't judge it by the number of \"amens.\"  Judge it by this and this alone **\"Did the preacher help me to understand better what the Bible says, and do I feel compelled to obey it?\"**\n\n---\n\nHis message was a Bible message.  But notice it wasn't just a message drawn from the Bible...\n\n## His arguments were Bible arguments.\n\nPaul is going to be making arguments about Jesus and who Jesus is.  But with every argument about Jesus being the savior, Jesus being the messiah, Jesus being resurrected, with every one - Paul goes to the scripture and backs up his argument with scripture.\n\nDo you know why?  Because the scriptures have final authority.  The word of God is the word of God.\n\nLook - you can disagree with my opinions.  If I stand up and preach my opinions - and you say \"Ok, pastor, that sounds good and all but I don't agree.\"  There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut if I carefully stick to the Bible and I give you what the Bible says and you walk away and say \"I don't agree with that.\" Then you aren't disagreeing with me - you are disagreeing with the Bible.  You are disagreeing with God.\n\nIt's my job not only to help you understand the Bible, it's my job to do so with such clarity and authority that you understand \"this is really what God is saying and I can either obey this or disobey God.\"\n\nThat's preaching with authority.\n\nLook - our authority isn't me yelling.  It isn't me getting all emotional.  Real authority comes when we see \"this is the word of God and we better obey it.\"\n\nSo Paul preached a Bible message.  Church, that's what the world needs to hear from us - the Bible.  It's still as relevant today as it was in Jesus' day.  Fashions may change.  Moral's may change - but this is the book that will last forever.  This book is the anchor that will keep us safe in the troubled seas of modern change. \n\nOn our logo, I don't know if you've noticed this, but there are words that are underneath it. Underneath it it says \"it lives, it speaks, it changes lives.\"\n\nThat's not a reference to our church.  That's a reference to the Bible.  The Bible is the only book that is alive.  \n\nHebrews 4:12 says\n\n> *\"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"*\n\nThe word of God is quick - it's alive.  And it speaks to us in a powerful way.\n\nIt's still speaking to the issues of today.  It's still guiding us.\n\nAnd do you know what? It changes lives. You find Jesus in this book, you find truth in this book, it changes lives.\n\nThere is a song I love and it's chorus says:\n\n```\nGod's Word changes lives\nIts power cannot be denied\nThe lost find salvation, the foolish become wise\nGod's Word changes lives\n```\n\nSo Paul preached the Bible.  But there was one specific message from the Bible that Paul wanted people to hear. \n\nNotice that...\n\n#  2. Paul preached Jesus.\n\nIn verse 23 Paul gets where he is going.  He gets to the main point.  Everything else so far has been runway.  But this is what he wants to talk to these people about.  Look what he says:\n\n> *\"Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus\"*\n\nPaul preached the Bible - but in order to really understand what the Bible says you have to understand what the Bible is all about - and the Bible is all about Jesus.  Everything from Genesis to Matthew points forward to Jesus.  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John tell the story of Jesus, then everything else looks back at Jesus.  It's all about Jesus.\n\nPeople need the Bible - but more than that, they need the Christ of the Bible. The Bible may be the vehicle for our message - but Jesus IS our message.  Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:23-24 \n\n> *\"We preach Christ crucified, unto the jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness, but unto them which are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"*\n\nHe said in Romans 1:16\n\n> *\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek\"*\n\nHe said in 2 Corinthians 4:5\n\n> *\"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.\"*\n\nI could go on and on.  Because truly, this is the theme of the whole Bible.  This is what it's all about.  It's all about Jesus.\n\nThis book contains rules - but it's not all about rules.  It contains prophecy - but its not a book about Prophecy.  There is plenty of pithy wisdom in this book - but it's not a self-help book.  It's a book about Jesus.\n\nAnd when Paul got a chance to preach - 10 times out of 10 He was going to preach Jesus.  \n\nSomebody asked Charles Spurgeon, the famous british preacher to describe his method and here is what he said, \"“I take my text and make a bee-line to the cross.”\n\nPaul preached Jesus, but notice in our text HOW he preached Jesus:\n\n## He preached Jesus prophesied. (21-23)\n\nHe went to the Old Testament and went through Old Testament history and as you are reading this you are thinking - ok Paul, where are you going with this.  He was trying to show these people that Christ was prophesied in the Old Testament.  That's what the word \"Christ\" means - it is the same word as \"messiah.\"  Jesus is the promised one.\n\nBut Paul didn't stay there, He told them WHY the Old testament promised Jesus...\n\n## He preached Jesus the savior (23b-29)\n\nIn verses 23 Paul says:\n\n> *\"God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus\"*\n\nHe took them to the cross.  He told them that the Jews senselessly took this promised one and killed him in the most unimaginable way possible. But - and you have to think like people who are hearing this for the first time like this audience was - He didn't present it as a bad thing.\n\nThink about this - let me tell you some good news, the person that was promised to save us has come - WooHoo!  Yes!  Ticker tape parade!  Dancing in the streets!  The savior is come!  Yes - and we killed Him!  Woohoo!  Yay!  Wait - why are you not cheering???\n\nImagine how strange that must have sounded to be told messiah had come and that the Jews had killed Him and to be told it with a smile on your face like it's a good thing. \n\nHow could Paul preach Jesus this way?\n\nLook at one more thing?\n\n## He preached Jesus triumphant (30-36)\n\nI know I alrady read a lengthy passage but let me read verses 29-37 again:\n\n> *\"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption\"*\n\nHere was what Paul was getting at.  Jesus. Jesus has come and He's fulfilled all of the promises. He's come to be our savior.  And He was killed - but He also fulfilled another promise - one you forgot about - He rose from the dead.\n\nHe truly is the Messiah.  He truly is the son of God.\n\n---\n\nNow, I want to stop here.  So Paul preached the Bible - He preached Jesus.  But there is a question every preacher must ask with every message: so what?  What does it matter to me?  How does this effect me?  \n\nLook at the third thing Paul preached and we'll be done:\n\n# 3. Paul preached the need to believe.\n\nLook at verses 38-42:\n\n> *\"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you\"*\n\nPaul didn't leave these people hanging.  He told them what God expected of them and he told them the consequences if they didn't do it.  He told them the best news they could ever hear and then he told them that they needed to act on it. They needed to believe.  \n\n\n","series":["recimYIKOri1oFH5g"],"service":"Sunday AM","slides":[{"id":"attm64Ih4mwCd0nFN","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/gXwV6bLLTpit4CJnH1Vm_Acts%2013-3.pdf","filename":"Acts 13-3.pdf","size":40770097,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attm64Ih4mwCd0nFN-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attm64Ih4mwCd0nFN-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"handout":[{"id":"attL7wcuAoi60EauZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/qJMjdZAkS620uw0LbaAA_Acts%2013-3%20handout.pdf","filename":"Acts 13-3 handout.pdf","size":37543,"type":"application/pdf","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attL7wcuAoi60EauZ-28x36.png","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/attL7wcuAoi60EauZ-512x663.png","width":512,"height":663}}}],"date":"2016-05-15","bible_text":"Acts 13:16-41","speaker":["reczJXlkg63judAaw"],"published":true,"speaker_name":["Ryan Hayden"],"speaker_bio":["Ryan Hayden has served as the pastor at Bible Baptist since 2011.
